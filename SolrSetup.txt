How to connect Solr to MongoDB:

1. Download Solr and unzip

2. From "/solr-7.0.1/solr-7.0.1/bin", run command: solr create_core -c agrifood_projects_core

3. In web browser, go to http://localhost:8983/solr/#/agrifood_projects_core/schema and use the web UI to add fields with names that match the ones in your MongoDB collection

4. Download Mongo Connector by running: pip install mongo-connector[solr]

5. When starting your Mongo server, make sure to add the replication set flag: --replSet "rs0"

6. Run: mongo-connector --unique-key id -n bc-agrifood-database-project.projects -m localhost:27017 -t http://localhost:8983/solr/agrifood_projects_core -d solr_doc_manager

This command should map every document from the MongoDB collection to the Solr 

7. In the Solr Web UI, go to the query page and run a basic query to select all. The response should be a JSON with a list of documents. If you see this, the mapping was successful.

Notes:

To delete every index in Solr:
http://localhost:8983/solr/agrifood_projects_core/update?stream.body=<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>
http://localhost:8983/solr/agrifood_projects_core/update?stream.body=<commit/>

Recent versions including 7.0.1 of Solr do not use the "schema.xml" anymore. Instead, you have to modify the schema through the Web UI, which creates a "managed-schema" file for you in the conf folder.
