"Improving the Growth, Health, and Survival of Tilapia in a Greenhouse-Enclosed Intensive Recirculating Aquaculture System"		"University of British Columbia (UBC), Viva Aquaculture and Seafood Distribution Ltd."	"Warm-water tilapia (Oreochromisniloticus) is becoming an important commercial freshwater fish in North America. Viva Aquaculture and Seafood Distribution Ltd. (Viva) in collaboration with The University of British Columbia (UBC) has engaged in sustainable tilapia aquaculture production to supply the strong market demand in British Columbia. To overcome technological uncertainties which cannot be removed using standard practice, the general project objective is to produce healthy tilapia in sustainable, environment-friendly, and in a less expensive way within a land-based facility without affecting the surrounding environment by generating “zero waste”. Based on biological principles, the research team has developed a sustainable land-based tilapia aquaculture system in a Canadian climate. Beneficial nitrifying bacteria were used to convert toxic nitrogenous wastes into non-harmful compounds, which are absorbed by selected aquatic vascular plants and microalgae. Innovative bio-engineering design to recirculate clean water and conserve heat to maintain suitable condition for tilapia culture was employed. A “zero waste” system is being developed to make fish production more sustainable, profitable, and environment-friendly. Our research has yielded initial results that show encouraging outcomes during the first year of project implementation. It is expected that employing these new innovations will lead to lower production cost, increased economic benefits, and improved fish quality; all of which will lead to an environmentally sustainable production of live tilapia. Culturing tilapia in a land-based, enclosed intensive recirculating system using innovative bioengineering design, beneficial microbes, algae, and vascular aquatic plants will lessen environmental impact, lower production cost, provide economic opportunities, and produce a healthy and diversified source of seafood for Canadian consumers."

"Enhancing Production in Coho: Culture, Community, Catch"		"Simon Fraser University (SFU), Université Laval (ULaval)"	"Coho Salmon, one of the most highly valued species in British Columbia (BC), began suffering declines in 1989 due to lower returns and high harvest rates to the point where the commercial fishery for Coho Salmon was essentially closed in 1997. Reopening the Coho Salmon fishery using recovered and enhanced populations would bring economic and social benefits to BC. The Enhancing Production In Coho: Culture, Community, Catch (EPIC4) project aims to develop and use new genomics tools to address challenges facing safe, secure, and sustainable production of Coho Salmon. The interdisciplinary team has sequenced the Coho Salmon genome and the first results have resolved clear patterns of regional populations structuring, both within BC and at the scale of the entire distribution range. Genotyping of the hatchery broodstocks sampled in 2014 and 2015 showed strong regional population structuring and allowed high levels of accuracy in assigning salmon to specific hatcheries or geographic regions. In addition, first results on the heritability and genetic correlation shed light on the genetic basis of flesh colour and the response of this trait to artificial selection for harvest weight over the time course of eight generations. The team is also working with stakeholders, including First Nations, regarding the implementation of EPIC4 scientific knowledge about Coho Salmon to help revive and sustain the wild Coho fisheries. The work on this project could lead to more economically viable Coho Salmon fisheries serving both domestic and export markets. Our results should also be transferable to other species of Pacific Salmon as well as salmonids from other regions of Canada."

Domestication Compromises Athleticism and Respiratory Plasticity in Response to Aerobic Exercise Training in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)		"University of British Columbia, Nofima AS (Norway), Marine Harvest ASA (Norway), University of Turku (Finland), University of Western Brittany Brest (France), Nord University (Norway)"	"In this project we address the possibility that the Norwegian Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) breeding program which focuses on commercially beneficial traits, such as rapid growth, may compromise the cardiorespiratory system. This may contribute to the mortality of smolts after seawater transfer. A suite of respiratory indices (including standard metabolic rate, maximum rate of oxygen uptake, absolute aerobic scope, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, critical oxygen level, and incipient lethal oxygen saturation) was used to evaluate aerobic capacity and hypoxia tolerance to test the hypothesis that exercise training improves the athletic robustness in both domesticated and wild strains of Atlantic Salmon. These hypotheses were tested with Atlantic Salmon parr of domesticated and wild strains that were reared under identical hatchery conditions. The two strains of fish were given either an 18-day exercise-training regime (an incremental water current of 2.0–2.8 FL s?1), or were maintained at the control water current (0.5 FL s?1) for 18 days. While exercise training produced several tangible benefits for the wild fish, it produced very few for the domesticated fish. This shows that the domesticated strain was athletically less robust than the wild strain. These results imply that approximately ten generations of selective breeding for rapid growth in commercial aquaculture have reduced the overall athletic robustness of domesticated salmon as compared to their wild conspecifics. Given the success in improving athletic robustness of the wild strain, it still remains to be seen whether an exercise training protocol can be developed that will provide benefits to the salmon aquaculture industry."

What is a Farmed Salmon? Understanding the Life of a Seafood Commodity from Ocean to Table		"University of Victoria (UVic), Duke University, Grieg Seafood BC Ltd., Marine Harvest Canada Limited"	"Farmed Atlantic Salmon is one of the world's most valuable and widely traded seafood commodities. Its consumption is driven by increased global consumer demand that can no longer be met by wild fisheries alone. It is now the fastest growing food production system in the world. It also provides jobs and revenue for many coastal communities, including in BC where the sector is a significant economic driver in some rural, largely resource-dependent communities, including some First Nations villages. However, despite its significant economic contributions, and the ever increasing global demand for the product, both current operations and growth of the sector in BC have been consistently challenged by social license constraints (community intolerance for new and increased aquaculture development) that reflect, among other things, the deeply embedded plurality of perspectives regarding farmed salmon. Research about farmed salmon can be widely found in the ecological, economic, and business literature; however, there is a noteworthy gap in the social sciences literature. This research uses multi-sited ethnographic methodology (observation, conversational interviews, and document analysis) to 'follow the fish' along the commodity chain-recording, comparing, and contrasting ideas, beliefs and knowledge about the product, both positive and negative, amongst people who engage with it on its path from production to consumption. Research sites include fish farms, processing plants, sales and distribution centres, and restaurants in Tofino, Port Hardy, Campbell River, and San Francisco. This research will produce rich, qualitative information from employees, customers, stakeholders, and others about the production processing, transport, culinary preparation, sales, and consumption practises for Atlantic Salmon farmed in BC. This information will increase our understanding of social-cultural issues along the entire value chain, contributing to the social license dialogue by providing greater understanding of the broader social-cultural perspectives about farmed salmon, at a time when the sector is pursuing new and increased opportunities in Canada and abroad."

Use of Hydro-Acoustic Methods to Assess the Migration Timing and Distribution of Juvenile Salmon in Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association (BCSFA)"	"During their migration to the Northern Pacific, juvenile wild salmon from the Strait of Georgia pass through the Discovery Islands and Lower Johnstone Strait, where salmon farming occurs. This project seeks to inform the risk of disease transfer associated with interactions between wild and farmed salmon in this area by studying wild salmon migratory pathways and the duration of their residency in the vicinity of these fish farms. In conjunction with traditional survey/sampling methods (including purse seining, beach seining, and trawling) using hydro-acoustics offers a cost-effective way of monitoring fish abundance, behaviours, and distribution for extended and continuous periods of time. This will enable observation and data collection on juvenile wild salmon migration in the area of fish farms, thus gaining insights into potential impacts of wild salmon on farmed salmon and vice versa. The results of this project will:
• Assist in informing a risk assessment process to investigate the risks of pathogen transfer from farmed to wild salmon, particularly in the Discovery Islands.
• Improve our understanding and inform and support the development of evidence-based aquaculture management approaches. 
• Provide information in addressing critical uncertainties and recommendations as identified in the Cohen Report with respect to: 
1. marine survival in their early marine life; 
2. disease transfer and interactions between wild and farm salmon; and
3. assessing the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on Fraser River Sockeye Salmon productivity.
• Inform operational decisions and best practices engaged in by the BC salmon aquaculture industry.

Migration Timing and Distribution of Juvenile Salmon in Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Marine Harvest Canada Limited, Grieg Seafood BC Ltd., Cermaq Canada"	"This research is determining how juvenile salmon utilize the Strait of Georgia, including the Discovery Islands area, with a focus on Fraser River Sockeye Salmon and to a lesser extent, Chinook Salmon. It will also provide the information required to fully assess the risks of disease transfer from salmon arms to the wild, understand the potential consequences of such transfers, and inform farm management policies. Purse seines and DFO trawl surveys have greatly increased the understanding of the migration and health of juvenile salmon within the Strait of Georgia, BC, especially for Sockeye Salmon. Surveys conducted in 2010–2012 revealed that Fraser River Sockeye Salmon do not enter the Discovery Islands area (a fish farming area) until the end of May, and that they are widely distributed throughout this area for at least part of June. To further assess risks associated with interactions between farmed and wild fish, information in the following key areas is needed: 1) knowledge of migratory pathways of salmon and the duration of their residency in the vicinity of fish farms; 2) knowledge of the prevalence of pathogens and diseases within wild and farmed populations; and 3) knowledge of environmental and host conditions during the periods wild salmon reside in the vicinity of fish farms. Additionally, more information is required to further understand when and for how long juvenile salmon are present in the vicinity of fish farms, as well as to describe migration timing of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon out of the Strait of Georgia. To gain this required information, sampling will be performed using a three-year trawl survey in the Strait of Georgia and a three-year purse seine combined with hydroacoustic surveys in Johnstone Strait."

Reduction of Ammonia and Solids from Chinook Salmon Culture Facilities		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), AgriMarine Industries Inc."	"In farmed fish, metabolic processes produce nitrogenous (principally ammonia) wastes which are released into the environment. That fish are not efficiently utilizing the feed for growth and maintenance represents a potential economic loss. Additionally, the release of nitrogenous wastes into the environment can have implications for the ecosystem and the fish farm, and regulatory consequences for culture facilities. This study explored how feed regimes designed to stimulate compensatory growth may be used during Chinook Salmon production to reduce nitrogen excretion into the environment and increase food utilization by the fish. When faced with modest periods of food deprivation, the salmon were found to maintain growth and excrete less nitrogen, despite the similarity of their final weights to the control group. This indicates that repeated short-term food deprivation of two days duration over a seven week cycle may provide a useful strategy for reducing nitrogen loss to the environment, while minimizing the loss of growth potential of the fish. The results of this research indicate the possibility for using cyclical feeding to reduce nitrogen excretion during salmon farming. This would be especially beneficial at land-based salmon farms with systems where the water discharge is focused to a single outflow, recirculating aquaculture, and multiple net-pens or tanks."

The Use of Kelp Perch and Pile Perch to Control Sea Lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on Infested Atlantic Salmon Smolts		"Vancouver Aquarium, Living Elements Ltd., Marine Harvest Canada Ltd., Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)"	"Sea lice infestations in farmed Atlantic Salmon require regular monitoring and, sometimes, treatments with chemicals such as SLICE®. Alternative methods to control sea lice infestations are needed to improve the sustainability of Atlantic Salmon farming. Biological controls as a method to control sea lice infestations have been considered as viable mitigation tools to reduce sea lice infestations for many years and are now being successfully used in Norway and Scotland, with cleaner fish such as wrasse and lumpfish. The goal of this research was to demonstrate if Kelp Perch (Brachyistius frenatus) and Pile Perch (Rhacochilus vacca) would clean sea lice off infested Atlantic Salmon. Several cohabitation trials have been performed whereby Kelp or Pile Perch were placed in tanks with sea lice infested salmon. While variation in feeding activity exists, perch of both species actively cleaned infested salmon of parasitic sea lice within 48 hours of cohabitation. Video evidence supports this result showing perch actively feeding on parasitic sea lice. Additionally, digested sea lice were found within cohabitating perch gastrointestinal tracts and in fecal casts recovered from experimental tanks. Salmon body condition and health showed no observable differences between experimental and control tanks, indicating that active sea lice predation by perch does not result in negative health impacts to infested salmon. This research addresses a large issue facing the salmon farming industry in BC by conducting research to find a sustainable way to reduce the environmental, economic, and public perception issues related to sea lice infestations in farm raised Atlantic Salmon. The use of cleaner fish to reduce sea lice infestations is an environmentally friendly solution to this issue of protecting wild salmon populations."

Wild Salmon Sea Lice Data Integration–Sea Lice Monitoring Network Development for Wild Salmon in Vancouver Island Coastal Waters		University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI)	"Sea lice monitoring programs on wild Pacific smolts have served to broaden the understanding of sea lice ecology and help to further develop sea lice management protocols on salmon farms. Studies where a large amount of annual data has been collected present a novel opportunity to study patterns over time, particularly where such studies offer structured snap-shots in space and/or time. To fully capture the value of these types of studies, it is essential that they be integrated for the purposes of comparison and aggregation. This program aims to create a single repository for sea lice monitoring data from wild fish in British Columbia (BC), collected by the salmon farming industry, and supplemented by additional data sets generated from conservation groups, academics, First Nations, and government. Large sets of consistent, annual data can be used in sea lice population studies, not only to determine abundance and intensity, but also to help map clustering patterns in predicting where sea lice will likely be most prevalent in a particular area by stage and time of year. The program is currently synthesizing existing sea lice data sets into a useful format to communicate historical data trends, while also collecting and storing data from current industry-sponsored sea lice monitoring programs. This includes ongoing monitoring of sea lice on wild fish. By bringing these data together, new opportunities will arise to conduct further analyses, report on trends noted in various regions, and increase transparency as well as the potential for information sharing. By integrating data sets from conservation groups, academia, First Nations, government, and salmon farming companies, greater analytical and modelling opportunities arise. This should ultimately benefit all contributing parties and the sustainability of the aquatic ecosystem along the BC coast."

Studies of Sea Lice Infection Levels on the Health of Juvenile Salmon in the Strait of Georgia and Adjacent Waters		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)	"To assess risk associated with sea lice and microbe transfer between farmed and wild salmon, we have undertaken a detailed study on the: 1) migratory pathways of wild salmon and the duration of their residency in the vicinity of fish farms; 2) the prevalence of pathogens and diseases within wild and farmed populations; and 3) the overall physiological well-being and health of wild populations as this impacts their susceptibility to infection. Using net-based surveys we have examined the duration of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon residency within the Strait of Georgia, as well as in the vicinity of salmon farms in the Discovery Islands. We have found that the majority of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon pass through the Discovery Islands over a two to three week period in early to mid-June. Caligus clemensi was the dominant species of sea lice present, but was in low abundance on juvenile salmon, Pacific Herring, and Three-spined Sticklebacks. There was no significant increase in the numbers of sea lice on juvenile salmon in the vicinity of salmon farms in the Discovery Islands. Infections with the Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV) and the parasites Parvicapsula minibicornis and Myxobulus articus have been seen in samples collected in the lower Fraser River and throughout the Strait of Georgia. The prevalence of infection of these agents is highly variable among years and stock of origin. We have neither found Piscine Orthoreovirus (PRV) nor Renibacterium salmoninarum in any of the fish that we tested."

The Effect of Dietary Camelina Oil on the Health of Salmon		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), University of Victoria (UVic), Creative Salmon Co. Ltd., Linnaeus Plant Sciences Inc., Taplow Ventures, Ltd."	"Traditional salmon feeds use high levels of fishmeal and fish oil to meet the nutritional needs of the fish, but these ingredients face large fluctuations in price and availability. Lower-cost alternatives have been investigated, including canola oil, soy oil, and poultry fat. Oil from the plant species Camelina sativa is another promising option that is already able to replace fish oil in diets for Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Salmon, and Rainbow Trout with little or no reduction in growth or feed efficiency. However, substitution of dietary fish oil with vegetable oils (such as Camelina oil) in fish feed may elicit inflammatory changes due to the different fatty acid profiles. There are limited data available on changes to the gut, and no data for vegetable oil’s health effects on Chinook Salmon. This project seeks to examine the influence of fish oil substitution by Camelina oil on susceptibility to intestinal inflammation of Chinook Salmon under culture conditions. Inflammation is energetically demanding and stressful, thus influencing disease resistance. By using Camelina oil to trigger gut inflammation in Chinook Salmon, results from this project will increase knowledge and understanding of these effects in order to develop better management practices surrounding disease impacts on cultured finfish species."

Investigating Probiotic Bacteria and Their Bacteriocins as Part of a Disease Management Strategy in Salmon Aquaculture		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.), Marine Harvest Canada Limited"	"On salmon farms, diseases caused by bacterial infections are managed by minimizing the risk of exposure to pathogens, vaccination, and ensuring the availability of sufficient high quality water and feed. There are concerns regarding the effectiveness and long term sustainability of using antibiotics to treat bacteria, so to help further reduce antibiotic use, this study focused on the therapeutic potential of probiotics in aquaculture. Probiotic bacteria can enhance the immune system of the fish, and can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which function in overall fish health. Probiotic bacteria may also secrete antimicrobial compounds that kill other bacteria, including fish pathogens. This project used probiotic bacteria and antimicrobials with activity against common salmon pathogens, and evaluated their application as feed additives to improve fish health. This project supports the DFO objective of optimal fish health. Specifically, this project found the following results: 
• Paenibacillus terrae and Paenibacillus polymyxa showed antimicrobial activity against five salmon pathogens. P. terrae was selected for further trials as it showed a stronger activity. 
• There was no evidence that the probiotic diets caused a reduction in feed attraction or appetite. 
• No significant effect of the probiotic diets was found on the survival rate of salmon after exposure to the pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. 
• P. terrae survived in salmon intestines but did not colonize the gut. 
• The results suggested that the live P. terrae diet may cause changes in the abundance and/or the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. This is currently being examined in more detail. 
• Increased knowledge of the effect of P. terrae on fish health will help determine its suitability as a therapeutic probiotic feed additive for salmon, which will benefit the aquaculture industry.

The Effects of Smolt Size on the Intensity of Kudoa thyrsites Infections in Atlantic Salmon		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Marine Harvest Canada Limited, Cermaq Canada"	"Atlantic Salmon infected with Kudoa thyrsites do not exhibit clinical signs of disease. However, protease secretion from this parasite rapidly deteriorates affected muscle in the salmon when the fillet is processed, resulting in economic loss for the grower. Earlier research suggested the risk of K. thyrsites was reduced when salmon were transferred to sea as larger smolts. This research project involves a more robust test of the size hypothesis by conducting trials that examine how smolts of a range of size classes respond to exposure to the K. thyrsites parasite. The results of this project may help to improve the competitiveness of the Canadian salmon aquaculture industry by assessing a problem that greatly affects the marketability of Atlantic Salmon produced in British Columbia. An understanding will be gained in the relative importance of fish size (smolts) in influencing the development of K. thyrsites. Data obtained from the project will help inform K. thyrsites management strategies.

"Estimating the Potential for Waterborne Transmission of Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) Disease between Salmon Farms and Wild Sockeye Salmon in the Discovery Islands, British Columbia"		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Marine Harvest Canada Limited, Grieg Seafood BC Ltd., Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.)"	"Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV) is responsible for major economic losses in British Columbia salmon aquaculture operations. Viral transmission patterns and oceanographic circulation models for the Discovery Islands region provide estimates for the potential of IHNV outbreak and spread to neighbouring farms. This study quantified the transmission potential of IHN disease between farms and wild Sockeye Salmon. It also determined the capacity of vaccinated Atlantic Salmon and IHNV-carrying Sockeye Salmon to transmit the virus to naïve hosts (ones who have never before been infected). Specifically this project found the following results: 
• Neighbouring naïve farms can become infected via waterborne transmissions. Adherence to the  stringent disease management practices (such as immediately quarantining an infected farm site) reduces transmission of infectious doses to other farms. 
• The model simulations demonstrated that using commercially available IHN vaccines greatly reduces the risk of transmission by lowering the overall number of susceptible fish. It also reduced the virus shedding capacity of the vaccinated farm population if it were to become infected with IHNV. To date, vaccinated farmed Atlantic Salmon populations have not developed IHN disease, while unvaccinated populations have been declared INHV positive. 
• With some modifications, the modelling tools can be applied to other diseases and to simulate transmission from farmed to wild populations and vice versa. It will be possible to estimate the risk of infection for fish swimming in proximity to diseased farms and assess the relative effectiveness of disease and farm management practices such as vaccination, quarantine, depopulation, and determining optimal locations for aquaculture sites.

The CCH is also developing a portfolio of fish health reports from data contained within the database. The overall objectives of this project are to: 
1) understand fish health information and accessibility needs, and to determine the uses and limitations of the BCSFA fish health database; 
2) design new fish health reports from the BCSFA database that assist farm management and aid in communications; and 
3) Identify changes that could be made to the database to expand its utility. The current fish health database functions as a repository of data, from which limited analysis can be conducted.

Microbial Impacts on Shellfish Aquaculture in Relationship to Ocean Acidification 		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Island Scallops Ltd., Fanny Bay Oysters Ltd."	"Ocean acidification (characterized by high dissolved carbon dioxide (pCO2) levels) can affect shellfish fertilization rates, hatching success, larval development, shell deformation, seed production, and survival. However, it is not clear whether high pCO2 levels alone are responsible for poor performance in some West Coast shellfish operations. While hatcheries have successfully controlled levels of pCO2 for larval and nursery production through the use of buffering systems, there have continued to be high variations in batch to batch survival. This suggests that other uncontrolled aspects of the seawater composition during high pCO2 events may be at play, most notably bacterial compositions. Researchers are applying a metabarcoding approach to assess the shifts in bacterial community composition that occur in sea water coming into a Pacific Northwest shellfish hatchery, post pCO2 buffering, and throughout larval culture and comparing bacterial compositions in larvae and water between batches of good and poor performance. Ultimately, the project will identify the degree to which initial pCO2 levels impact bacterial communities of cultured shellfish and identify whether certain bacterial species are more common in seed batches demonstrating poor survival. The knowledge obtained through this research will be useful in the development of a mitigation strategy to reduce the impact of ocean acidification on the shellfish industry on Canada’s West Coast. Additionally, the identification of factors that contribute to farmed shellfish mortality may lead to the development of monitoring tools. This would ultimately assist the industry in enhancing environmental sustainability and economic viability of shellfish aquaculture. This project supports the DFO objective of optimal fish health."

The Effects of Prior Exposure and Body Size on the Intensity of Kudoa thyrsites Infections in Farmed Atlantic Salmon		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Marine Harvest Canada Limited, Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.)"	"The parasite Kudoa thyrsites is the cause of soft-flesh syndrome in post-harvest Atlantic Salmon farmed in British Columbia. Infected fish exhibit no clinical signs of disease, but affected muscle deteriorates after processing depending on the severity of infection. The industry in BC is subject to substantial economic loss because of Kudoa-associated changes to fillet quality. Currently, there are no vaccines or approved strategies for treatment for K. thyrsites. This study investigated three management options for K. thyrsites infections: 
• The efficacy of ultraviolet irradiation of seawater as a method to inactivate K. thrysites in the laboratory.
• The influence of prior exposure to K. thyrsites on parasite development during subsequent exposure.
• The influence of fish size on the prevalence and severity of the infection. The knowledge gained through this research project will lead to a greater understanding of disease transmission and wild-farmed interactions. Additionally, this information will allow for better finfish cage siting and decision making and the development of tools to help further manage this disease. This project supports the DFO objective of optimal fish health. Specifically, the following results were found: 
• Ultraviolet irradiation of seawater significantly reduces risk of infection in Atlantic Salmon. UV-irradiation is not practical in current net pen production systems, but would prove valuable in a closed-containment system. 
• Previous infection with K. thyrsites reduces the risk of a severe subsequent infection. This is consistent with observations made by industry that initial rearing of smolts at a low-risk site reduces the severity of infection following transfer to high-risk sites. It would be valuable to further investigate alternative methods of simulating an earlier exposure. 
• No consistent relationship between fish size and susceptibility to K. thrysites was observed. Further research will explore alternative methods of testing the size hypothesis.

Net Pen Liver Disease Project–Developing a Fluorescent Antibody Test to Prove the Causative Agent		"Grieg Seafood BC Ltd., BC Ministry of Agriculture"	"An incidence of Net Pen Liver Disease (NPLD) was diagnosed in a population of adult Atlantic Salmon at a Grieg Seafood farm site in Nootka Sound, British Columbia, June 25, 2014. Previous presentations of the disease at company sites were limited to poor performers, three to four months post sea water entry. This new presentation was different as it affected well established grow out fish of approximately 3.6 kg. Based upon historical information, the disease had been associated with a hepatotoxic mycrocystin–LR (MC). Phase 1 of the project was to develop a fluorescent antibody test to positively identify the microcystin toxin present in affected fish. Histological surveys of smolts (500 g) growing within an adjacent inlet did not test positive for NPLD; feed rate and mortality remained normal. Water samples were taken from the affected site and a site located geographically distant from the affected site both tested positive for the presence of MC. Atlantic Salmon were experimentally exposed to the microcystin toxin thought to be the causative agent of the disease. Liver tissue samples were harvested over various timescales and the tissues were sent to the Animal Health Centre in Abbotsford, BC for histological processing and evaluation. Samples with lesions attributed to toxin exposure were used to develop a fluorescent antibody which was able to detect the presence of the toxin. Future work will optimize the test including determining both the level of sensitivity of the antibody and the strength of antibody required for accurate testing. This study provides proof of concept for the causative agent for Net Pen Liver Disease."	AUG. 2016	MAR. 2017	Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.

"The market demand for live Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in Metro-Vancouver is steadily increasing. The stress and physical injury that occurs to fish during transport from USA to Langley, B.C. for acclimation and maintenance prior to retail sales have resulted in high fish mortalities and large economic losses to Viva Aquaculture and Seafood Distribution Ltd. (Viva). Developing viable and sustainable protocols to improve the survival, health, and quality of post-transported fish will benefit the company and retailers economically, and will also provide consumers with better food safety and quality fish products. It will also lead to new economic and employment opportunities locally, as well as be a source of diversified and nutritious seafood products for consumers in British Columbia. The University of British Columbia (UBC) and Viva have established a research collaboration to improve the survival and quality of fish transported from USA to Langley, BC. The specific objectives of this collaborative project were: 
1) to increase the survival rate of adult Tilapia transported from Idaho, USA, by improving water quality through the manipulation of salinity, alkalinity, hardness, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, and the elimination of toxic nitrogenous wastes; and 
2) to improve the quality and food safety of fish during the post-transport recuperation and acclimation period using government-approved therapeutants and prophylactics, as well as indigenous microalgae, to eliminate potential microbial pathogens that might be present in the source water used to transport the fish from USA. 
The results of this research project will lead to the development of post-transport protocols that are applicable in a commercial scale; are viable, efficient, safe, and sustainable for the maintenance rearing of adult fish destined for the retail market and human consumption in Canada.

Marine Reservoirs of Infectious Agents Associated with Proliferative Gill Disorders in Farmed Salmon		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), BC Ministry of Agriculture, Marine Harvest Canada Limited, British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association (BCSFA)"	"Gill diseases and disorders among Atlantic Salmon raised in seawater net pens are an emergent and important cause of losses. There is a need to better describe the causes, distribution, and possible control of gill diseases, which have been attributed to infections with parasites, bacteria, viruses, as well as exposure to algal blooms, jellyfish, and other non-infectious agents. This project focuses on associations of viruses and parasites such as Paramoeba perurans and Desmozoon lepeophtherii with proliferative gill disorders (PGD) in order to improve understanding of reservoirs of infections. Infectious causal factors will be studied in populations of wild and farmed salmon sharing common bodies of water to better understand the epidemiology of proliferative gill disorders. This project will develop knowledge related to the distribution and causes of PGD in British Columbia, which will inform further development of farmed fish health management strategies and improve the understanding of the role of gill disorders in the conservation of wild salmon."

Pathogen Susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon–Phase 1: Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) and Salmon Alphavirus (SPDV or SAV)		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Marine Harvest Canada Limited"	"In recent years, Sockeye Salmon populations in Canada have been experiencing declines in productivity; of particular note is the Fraser River Sockeye Salmon stock. The reasons for this decline remain speculative but it is thought the susceptibility of Sockeye to pathogens may be a key contributing factor. However, the susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon to Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) or Salmon Alphavirus (SPDV or SAV) has never been tested. These pathogens are known to affect cultured Atlantic Salmon in various salmon producing regions and countries (e.g., ISAV on the east coast of Canada, ISAV and SPDV in Norway). This project examines the disease resistance or susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon to pathogens known to affect Atlantic Salmon and the potential transmission of disease for a priority list of pathogens (ISAV, SPDV). Additionally, this project compares the viral response to ISAV at a cellular level (e.g., using gill tissue) between Sockeye and Atlantic Salmon, and their long-term immunity in response to exposure. This research is necessary in order to predict the consequences of an introduction or outbreak of these pathogens at an aquaculture site to the health and sustainability of Sockeye Salmon. The outcome of this work will allow Fisheries and Oceans Canada to improve disease surveillance, detection and management strategies, and help to minimize the impacts of pathogens on cultured and wild fish."

Marine Reservoirs of Infectious Agents Associated with Proliferative Gill Disorders in Farmed Salmon		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited	"Gill diseases contribute to economically important production losses in Atlantic Salmon aquaculture. This project will improve our understanding of reservoirs of infections with infectious agents associated with these disorders. One of these, amoebic gill disease (AGD), was diagnosed for the first time in BC in 2014 and the causative agent, Paramoeba perurans, has been detected in BC. Another agent that is associated with proliferative gill inflammation (PGI) in Europe, the microsporidian, Desmozoon lepeophtherii, has been detected in BC and Washington State. Several cases of a PGI-like condition were reported in farmed salmon in BC in 2015. This project capitalizes on an opportunity to benefit from a unique set of samples; juvenile salmon collected by industry as part of their sea lice certification program. Specifically, these samples will be examined for evidence of their involvement as reservoirs of infection with agents associated with proliferative gill disorders in farmed salmon. The objectives of this project are to: 
1) determine distribution of P. perurans and D. lepeophtherii in wild Pacific Salmon and salmon lice collected in proximity to marine netpens; 
2) describe the occurrence of proliferative gill lesions in wild fish; 
3) characterize the genomic sequence of BC variants of P. perurans and D. lepeophtherii; and 
4) conduct laboratory transmission studies to identify and quantify (host and environmental) parameters surrounding transmission of the causative agent between candidate reservoir species and Atlantic Salmon. 
These objectives reflect the knowledge gaps concerning PGI and causal agents in farmed salmon in BC. The key anticipated project outcome will be knowledge related to the distribution and causes of PGI in BC. This knowledge will inform further development of farmed fish health management strategies.

Epidemiological Analysis and Modelling of Aquatic Pathogens		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Centre for Coastal Health Society	"One of the big questions concerning disease processes of aquatic pathogens is what factors influence pathogen prevalence in wild and cultured fish populations. The prevalence and intensity of pathogens can vary annually within and between fish stocks, yet the drivers behind such annual fluctuations remain unresolved. Some fish populations can be free of virus one year, yet be greater than 80% positive in subsequent years. The occurrence of such dramatic “on and off periods” begs the questions “Why now?” and “Why was there an absence of virus in previous years?” To better understand variations in aquatic pathogen prevalence in wild and farmed populations, this project will use epidemiological analytical approaches to study the patterns of aquatic pathogens in wild and cultured fish populations with the goal of identifying the factors that influence the occurrence of pathogens and disease. To help understand the main drivers of pathogen epidemiology in aquatic systems, this project will: 
1) gather and assemble a comprehensive dataset of fish health analyses and salmon population metrics across multiple river systems; 
2) examine and compare annual pathogen prevalence among wild sockeye populations from multiple river systems; and 
3) Explore host, pathogen and environmental factors for potential correlates with pathogen variability in wild sockeye populations.

Physiological Consequences of Piscine Orthoreovirus (PRV) Infection of Atlantic and Pacific Salmonids		Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of British Columbia (UBC); British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association (BCSFA)	"Piscine Orthoreovirus (PRV) commonly occurs in healthy salmon which are asymptomatic of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) disease. The capacity of PRV to establish long-term infections and the potential association with the HSMI disease in fish has raised concerns towards its ability to impact salmon physiology and overall fish health. As such, the role of PRV in HSMI continues to be studied. This project aims to determine if PRV infections have physiological consequences and whether the virus can directly impact salmon health. This laboratory study addresses these questions by evaluating the cardiorespiratory performance (swimming ability) of PRV-infected Atlantic and Sockeye Salmon in comparison to uninfected controls. Oxygen binding potential and maximum oxygen consumption will be measured and compared between infected and non-infected individuals. This research builds on other studies about PRV. The outcome of this study will provide a better understanding of whether PRV infections are associated with physiological consequences. Results of the study will inform Fisheries and Oceans Canada management strategies for PRV.

Developing a Genomics Tool (FIT-CHIP) for In-Season Information on Salmon Health		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of British Columbia (UBC)	"Climate change, genetic challenges, ecological inconsistency, and disease can all be listed as potential stressors to wild populations of salmon on Canada’s West Coast. This project plans to address the physical states of wild populations through the development of a series of “salmon FIT-CHIPs” which will be used as a predictor of salmon condition. The system offers extreme flexibility, allowing biological markers to be easily customized for stress or other conditional states to different life-history stages, environments, and in different tissues. This tool will provide the first in-season method to incorporate information on salmon condition into fisheries management decision making. A text search will be conducted on abstracts or full papers for key protein (biomarkers) word associations that have been linked to a given stressor. The project will then continue by data-mining the huge in-house microarray databases produced from dozens of studies that encompass more than 4,900 microarrays and three salmon species (Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho) as well as over 60 stress-challenge microarray studies conducted across a broad range of salmon species available in public databases. Tests will be developed that should work across all three species, and preferentially across Atlantic Salmon and Rainbow Trout as well. In all, it is anticipated that five FIT-CHIPS will be developed through this project. The ultimate aim is to discover biomarkers predictive of the presence of specific stressors or conditions and to translate these into a tool (FIT-CHIP) that can inexpensively and rapidly identify the presence of multiple stressors or conditions in a group of fish at once.

Susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon to Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); United States Geological Survey	"As part of the sustainable management of finfish aquaculture, there are regulatory requirements that are designed to minimize the transfer of pathogens from farmed finfish to wild fish. However, finfish cultured in ocean net pens have the potential to be exposed to naturally occurring pathogens and to transfer pathogens to wild fish. Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) has been identified in farmed Atlantic Salmon, Salmo salar, in British Columbia. VHSV is a naturally occurring pathogen in British Columbia and is a cause of serious disease in wild Pacific Herring, Clupea pallasii. Pacific Herring are known to enter and remain in Atlantic Salmon net pens, thereby increasing the potential for the virus to be transferred to farmed Atlantic Salmon. Although the occurrence of VHSV in farmed salmon is rarely accompanied with significant disease and mortality, experimental studies have shown that the VHS virus can persist in the tissue of farmed Atlantic Salmon. This causes concern for potential host adaptation and viral spillback to fish sharing the marine environment. This study is investigating what effect, if any, the occurrence of VHSV in farmed Atlantic Salmon may have on wild Sockeye Salmon. Previous studies have shown that Coho, Chinook, and Chum Salmon are natural hosts of VHSV, but less is known about the susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon to VHSV. To address this knowledge gap, this project will determine the susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon smolts to VHSV using laboratory exposure studies. The results of this study will contribute to the development of adaptive management strategies in British Columbia aimed at minimizing the transfer of pathogens between farmed Atlantic Salmon and wild Pacific salmon."

Developing Hard-Bottom Indicators from BC Archived Benthic Video Surveys Associated with Aquaculture Activities		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)	"Under the Aquaculture Activities Regulations (AAR), and previously as a condition of licence, the Pacific aquaculture industry has been required to conduct seafloor monitoring of finfish aquaculture sites. This project is applying a standard analytical approach to a large collection of archived video surveys collected during a seven-year period (2004-2010) and over a wide range of coastal settings (fjordic inlets, Broughton Archipelago, the west coast of Vancouver Island, Johnstone Strait, etc.). The measurement of redox and sulphide from sediment samples is an accepted standard practice for soft-bottom seabeds. However, past monitoring practices involving grab sampling for redox and sulfide analyses have presented challenges at aquaculture sites located over hard bottom substrates. Section 10(2) of the AAR allows for visual monitoring instead of sediment grab samples if it is not possible to obtain benthic substrate samples. Results supported the use of primary and secondary indicator species (Beggiatoa spp. and Opportunistic Polychaete Complexes–OPC). Potential additional indicators that may warrant further investigation include Giant Plumose Anenomes as this species is tolerant to organic enrichment and was observed as co-occurring with Beggiatoa-like bacteria and OPCs at some farm sites, as well as taxa that tend to occur at the transition between oxic states could be investigated (e.g., sea urchins, brittle stars, tube dwelling anemones, shrimp, etc.)."

Development and Validation of a Biomonitoring Tool to Assess the Impacts of Salmon Aquaculture on Marine Benthic Communities Using Metabarcoding		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), University of Geneva"	"Salmon aquaculture causes organic enrichment of surrounding sediments which has been shown to affect biodiversity and biomass of benthic fauna concomitant with sediment chemical changes. Environmental impact assessments have generally focused on changes in macro-invertebrate communities based on manual taxonomic identification, requiring a substantial investment of labour and taxonomic expertise, or have relied on abiotic proxies like sulfide measurements with uncertain accuracy and reliability. Next-generation DNA sequencing methods offer an efficient and reliable lower-cost alternative by cataloging the diversity and abundance of benthic communities through metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA). This approach has been successful at identifying environmental impacts associated with farming activities in Scotland, New Zealand, and Norway. This project will develop a new eDNA-based metabarcoding tool for assessing the impacts of farming on benthic metazoan and foraminiferan communities in BC and will validate its use for ongoing biomonitoring through comparisons with existing methods. This research will also address existing knowledge gaps about the impacts of salmon farming on benthic metazoans and foram communities and enrich DNA barcode databases for these taxa from BC inshore waters."

Paving the Way for Salmon-Kelp Integrated Aquaculture in British Columbia: A Foundational Field Trial Assessing Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima) Growth and Quality at BC Salmon Farms		"North Island College (NIC); Cermaq Canada Ltd.; Creative Salmon Company Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Mac’s Oysters Ltd.; Odyssey Shellfish Ltd.
"	"Kelp is a fast-growing marine crop that requires virtually zero energy inputs, utilizing sunlight and dissolved nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) from the surrounding environment for growth. This study examined the feasibility of growing kelp on commercial salmon farm tenures where levels of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus may be locally-enriched. In January 2016, Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima) seed was deployed on 5 m vertical polyethylene lines at 15 salmon farms and two oyster farms around Vancouver Island. Kelp was harvested in the summer after approximately 150 days; frond length, width, wet/dry weight, proximate analysis, and metal accumulation were measured. Maximum frond length ranged from <20 cm to >330 cm, depending on the site. Proximate analysis (KJ, protein, ash, fat, calories, carbohydrates, moisture) of dried kelp revealed site-specific differences in nutritional parameters, with carbohydrates ranging from 20.4% to 47.5% of tissue dry weight. Metal accumulation (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Pb, Zn) in kelp tissue from the 15 salmon farms is being measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). A follow-up, more intensive kelp production trial at select sites will commence in 2017 using horizontal kelp lines deployed from customized floating rafts. The siting of many salmon farm operations in British Columbia would support excellent Sugar Kelp production, a sustainable crop with diverse commercial applications. Through field studies such as this we hope to demonstrate the feasibility of salmon-kelp integrated aquaculture in BC with the goal of improving the environmental and socio-economic performance of salmon farm tenures.

The Effects of Sublethal Aquaculture Chemotherapeutant Exposure on Pink Salmon		Simon Fraser University (SFU)	"An improved understanding of chemical impacts on near-shore ecosystems is essential to responsible stewardship of Canada’s coastal areas. In order to accurately assess the risk to non-target marine fish species posed by the use of the chemotherapeutants emamectin benzoate, azamethiphos, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, or hydrogen peroxide in the receiving environment, information regarding their sublethal toxicity is essential. Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) embryos were hatched in the laboratory, transferred to seawater, and raised until they were the appropriate size for swimming and behavioural assays following exposure (pulse: 1 h, 3 h, 6 h; and longer term: 96 h) to several concentrations of each aquaculture chemical. Fish were tested for swimming performance using a measure of critical swimming speed (Ucrit), avoidance/attraction behaviour, and the ability to detect food. All aquaculture pesticides (except hydrogen peroxide) reduced Ucrit values at concentrations below 96 h-LC50 values determined for this species in preliminary toxicity tests. For azamethiphos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and emamectin benzoate, concentration-dependent reductions in swim performance were seen. Fish actively avoided all chemicals except deltamethrin at similar concentrations and avoidance to hydrogen peroxide only occurred at the highest concentration. Following exposure to each chemical at various concentrations for longer exposures (6 and 96 h), a loss of attraction to food was noted in olfactory response tests. The data obtained from this research will allow regulators to assess the risks posed to the environment adjacent to salmon aquaculture facilities and the risks posed to non-target fish species from chemotherapeutant use. New data will support assessments of risks posed to the environment adjacent to salmon aquaculture facilities and the risks posed to non-target fish species from chemotherapeutant use.

"The Lethal, Physiological, and Behavioural Effects of Anti-Sea Lice Therapeutants in Non-Target Crustacean Species"		Simon Fraser University (SFU)	"Environmental contamination and effects on non-target organisms associated with the chemotherapeutic control of sea lice infestations in salmonid aquaculture has emerged as a significant concern. This research specifically addresses information gaps that need to be filled to properly manage any risks associated with the use of three chemicals currently used in Canada. Several shrimp species were tested for the acute lethal effects of current-use chemicals: the reference species Mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia East coast species), and several species of Pacific shrimp including the Coonstripe (Pandalus hypsinotus), Dock (Pandalus danae), and Pink Shrimp (Pandalus jordani), Spot Prawn (Pandalus platyceros), Ghost Shrimp (Neotrypaea spp.), and an unidentified sand shrimp. Shrimp were exposed to at least five concentrations of either SLICE®, Salmosan®, or Paramove 50® for 1 to 96 h. Juvenile Pacific coast shrimp were equally as sensitive to all three chemicals as their east coast counterparts. Spot Prawn (Pandalus platyceros) exposed to water containing the active ingredients of SLICE®, Salmosan®, and Paramove 50® (emamectin benzoate, azimethiphos, and hydrogen peroxide) resulted in concentration-dependent increases in oxygen consumption. In a choice/ avoidance assay, unexposed Spot Prawns, acclimated in a shuttle box apparatus, showed conflicting results to hydrogen peroxide, emamectin benzoate, and azamethiphos at several concentrations. Prawns were actively attracted and actively avoided all chemicals at low concentrations. This research will ensure the appropriate regulation of chemotherapeutant use in Canadian aquaculture and maintain the goal of protecting non-target organisms in the marine environment. New data will support assessments of risk from current-use chemotherapeutants posed to a range of non-target benthic crustaceans found in proximity to Pacific salmon aquaculture facilities.

The Effects of Anti-Sea Lice Chemotherapeutants on Sensitive Life Stages of Non-Target Crustacean		Simon Fraser University (SFU)	"Species in Combination with Environmental Stressors There is specific concern regarding the use of the anti-sea lice therapeutants Salmosan®, SLICE®, and Paramove 50® in the aquaculture industry specifically in regard to their toxicity to Pacific coast region organisms. In real world scenarios, organisms are often challenged with multiple environmental stressors simultaneously, including those of a physical nature (e.g., oxygen, temperature, and salinity fluctuations). In these studies, the range of oxygen, temperature, and salinity tolerances in Spot Prawn, Pandalus platyceros, were determined in order to design experiments to measure the acute toxicity of these chemicals under varying physical conditions. In acute lethality studies, Spot Prawn juveniles and adults were exposed to five concentrations of each individual chemical formulation in glass 40-L glass aquaria for up to 96 h under varying oxygen, temperature, and salinity conditions. Juvenile Spot Prawns were much more sensitive to all chemicals than adults, and acute toxicity was exacerbated by exposure to physical conditions approaching tolerable limits. In particular, oxygen concentrations, followed by temperature, and then salinity had the most pronounced effects on increasing chemical toxicity. This research specifically addresses information gaps that need to be filled in order for proper assessments of the environmental consequences of sea lice pesticide use in Canada to be made. This research provided information on the toxicity of these chemicals under environmentally realistic conditions to a representative and sensitive Pacific coast marine organism. New data will support assessments of risk from chemotherapeutant use in combination with environmental stressors posed to a non-target benthic crustacean found in proximity to Pacific coast salmon aquaculture facilities.

The Environmental Fate and Non-Target Effects of Sea Lice Drugs and Pesticides Used in Salmon Aquaculture		"Simon Fraser University (SFU), Nautilus Environmental"	"Five chemotherapeutants used globally to control sea lice in salmon farming operations of particular interest with regard to their fate and toxicity are: deltamethrin, cypermethrin, azamethiphos, hydrogen peroxide, and emamectin benzoate; the latter three of which are currently used in Canada. Predictions of the persistence and toxicity of these chemicals to non-target organisms has been difficult, and data gaps make estimations of risk highly inaccurate. The main objectives of this research were to assess: 1) the environmental persistence and partitioning of these compounds, and 2) their acute and sublethal toxicity to non-target marine organisms. In micrososm experiments, the partitioning behaviour, and water and sediment half-lives were determined. Emamectin benzoate, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin partitioned mainly into sediments, while azimethiphos and hydrogen peroxide remained in the aqueous phase. Generally, the persistence of these chemicals was cypermethrin > deltamethrin > emamectin benzoate > azimethiphos > hydrogen peroxide. In standardized acute toxicity tests, the susceptibility to each chemical was species-specific and no general trends were evident. Kelp Macrocystis pyrifera germination and growth were only affected by hydrogen peroxide. Echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus fertilization was affected by cypermethrin > deltamethrin > emamectin benzoate > hydrogen peroxide. Bivalve Mytilus edulis development was affected by hydrogen peroxide > emamectin benzoate > azamethiphos. For the mysid Americamysis bahia, all chemicals tested were highly toxic at concentrations far below those used in aquaculture (deltamethrin > cypermethrin > emamectin bezoate > azimethiphos > hydrogen peroxide). This research yields important information required to ensure the proper and safe use of aquaculture pesticides, and to appropriately regulate these important aquaculture chemicals to protect the environment. New information on the environmental fate and non-target toxicity of five chemotherapeutants will inform decisions on the responsible use and management of these products for the control of sea lice.

Scraped samples and high-resolution photos of the community at each site are being collected seasonally from billets on all sides of the farm. The abundance (biomass per unit area) and composition (biodiversity) of the communities will be compared within and between sites over time. In addition to seasonal billet sampling, five hard plastic panels were deployed at 1 m depth at each site and will remain in the water undisturbed (with the exception of being photographed) for 18 months. These will be used to document and compare the settlement rate and composition in different farming environments. Understanding the community of native species inhabiting fish farm infrastructure over time and in different locations will help identify key relationships between salmon farms and the surrounding environment, providing insight into the function of these dynamic communities.

Tracking in Situ Real-Time Responses of Ocean Acidification Effects on Biological Organisms and Influence on Plankton Diversity		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Vancouver Island University (VIU); Microthalassia Inc.; Hakai Institute	"Coastal margins are under increasing human-induced pressures including eutrophication and ocean acidification, which interact with natural environmental fluctuations in ways that can exacerbate calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral corrosivity. Ocean acidification negatively impacts a range of species, especially those dependent on CaCO3 saturation states for shell formation, including socio-economically important species like marine shellfish. The capacity for marine populations to adapt to these changes is unknown, and the loss of dominant coastal and estuarine organisms such as shellfish may significantly alter marine ecosystem structure and function, as well as threaten food security. This research combines lower trophic level monitoring (plankton analysis), physiological responses (functional genomics of multiple species of shellfish) and high speed (0.5Hz) near real-time oceanographic monitoring at a field site in the northern Salish Sea in British Columbia (BC). This initial project is a novel pairing of these technologies in situ, and provides information on coastal variability and impacts on ecosystem productivity in a poorly sampled portion of the BC coastal margin. This work is currently ongoing, but preliminary results of gene expression studies of multiple commercial shellfish species and accompanying plankton work are underway. Recent equipment updates have allowed direct sampling of biological responses to ocean acidification conditions in a real world environment, to enable the examination of the impact of ocean acidification on the long-term health and productivity of coastal ecosystems in BC and elsewhere."

"Robustness of Alternative Benthic Impact Indicators: Quantification of Spatial and Temporal Variability of Alternative Methods, and Application at Aquaculture Sites Across Different Farm and Environmental Conditions "		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)	"Benthic effects associated with biochemical oxygen demanding (BOD) matter effluents at aquaculture sites are currently assessed by monitoring the oxic state of surficial sediment. The Aquaculture Activity Regulations (AAR) require measurements of sulfide concentrations around finfish aquaculture sites as a proxy for benthic biodiversity impacts. However, it has been widely recognized that there are some problems with current protocols used for monitoring the oxic state of sediments. Alternative methods for measuring sulfide and oxygen concentrations have been developed that may address some of the weakness of the methods traditionally used. This project will test these new methodologies and technologies across a range of aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) and seabed conditions (mud, sand, and mixed) in Canada to determine the general applicability of these methods for reaching conclusions on sediment oxic state and related benthic impacts, and to measure the temporal and spatial variability in oxic state indicators among these different methods."

In various provinces, sulfide concentrations in sediment are measured as the fundamental indicator of environmental impacts from aquaculture. Because each provincial government has established its own SOPs for interpreting sulfide concentrations, the evaluation of environmental impacts could differ among provinces. Previous research has revealed that the standard solutions (“standards”) used in sediment sulfide monitoring and probe accuracy (post-calibration) degrade significantly over time.

• Sample collection: No one sampler worked well in all sediment types investigated. In all sediment types, multiple samples may need to be taken before an acceptable one is collected. Video footage of deployment and retrieval of gear was useful in assessing gear performance and confidence in the integrity of collected samples.
• Sample storage: During storage, sediment sulfide concentration changed over time, depending on sediment type, level of sulfide present, and storage temperature. To reduce variability due to storage, all samples should be treated uniformly until analyzed. 
• Sample analysis: Sulfide measurements should be made as soon as possible after collection, with a standardized time of analysis established. The differing ages of probes used in analyses were not a concern in readings.

2010–2017: Seven Productive Years for the Canadian Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture Network (CIMTAN)		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Simon Fraser University (SFU); University of Victoria (UVic); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ), New Brunswick Research and Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Limited; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd."	"After seven years of intense activities, between 2010 and 2017, the NSERC strategic network, the Canadian Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture Network (CIMTAN), is finished. The aim of CIMTAN’s research was to ecologically engineer systems for increased environmental sustainability (ecosystem services and green technologies for improved ecosystem health), economic stability (improved output, lower costs, product diversification, risk reduction, and job creation in coastal and rural communities), and societal acceptability (better management practices, improved regulatory governance, nutrient trading credit incentives, and appreciation of differentiated and safe products). The Network was organized into three linked Domains: 1) environmental system performance and species interactions; 2) system design and engineering; and 3) economic analyses and social implications. Each Domain was co-led by one scientist at an academic institution and one at a Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) laboratory. The entire Network was comprised of 28 scientists from 8 universities, 6 DFO laboratories, 1 provincial government laboratory (New Brunswick Research and Productivity Council), and 4 industrial partners. The Network was hosted by the University of New Brunswick in Saint John (UNBSJ), where the Scientific Director of the Network was located. The budget for CIMTAN was nearly $12.8 M over the 7 years of its existence. This was consequential as it enabled the Network to obtain far-reaching achievements along the continuum R&D&C (commercialization). Of this, over $5 M was received from NSERC with the rest leveraged through both cash and in-kind contributions from government, academic, and industrial partners. Training of highly qualified personnel (HQP) was a very high priority for CIMTAN and 137 HQP (120% of the initial target) were trained: 76 undergraduate students, 35 Masters students, 6 PhD students, 7 postdoctoral fellows, 12 technicians, and 1 research scientist. CIMTAN enabled the priming of young talents so they could enter a highly skilled labour force well-prepared, capable of thinking critically and independently, and well-versed in the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. Our CIMTAN HQP have either pursued higher academic degrees or found jobs in a variety of sectors (academic, industrial, regulatory or non-governmental). It is interesting to see how these HQP have become respected professionals and remarkable agents of knowledge dissemination and technology transfer in several sectors, to the extent that it is no longer necessary to re-explain what IMTA is about at each meeting. CIMTAN was always interested in disseminating and translating its scientific research, results, and perspectives. CIMTAN produced a substantial number of publications (617), testifying to the accomplishments and vitality of the Network. More than 1150 contacts were made with 232 media outlets across 42 countries, through interviews or citations. The deliberate choice to use a diverse array of documents and media platforms (scientific papers, papers and abstracts in conference proceedings, book chapters, theses, reports, professional magazines articles, newspapers/ radio/TV interviews and documentaries, public school activities, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, YouTube videos, CIMTAN Snippets newsletter, Wikipedia, etc.) has enabled the Network to reach varied targeted fields and audiences in Canada and beyond, and to spread the IMTA message widely with researchers, federal and provincial agencies, the industry, professional associations, coastal and rural communities, First Nations, national and international environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs), and the general and school public. Two media were very successful at reaching audiences beyond those associated with the traditional scientific dissemination tools: the Network newsletter CIMTAN Snippets and 15 videos posted on YouTube. There were 40 issues of CIMTAN Snippets over 6 years, totaling 331 pages of information about the activities of the Network, sent to 842 subscribers, some of whom are known to have redistributed CIMTAN Snippets to others. YouTube has been a very efficient dissemination platform for the IMTA concept and the principles on which it is based. By December 31, 2016, the IMTA YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/ imtacanada/videos) had reached 85,334 total views of its 15 videos. The following research articles in this section describe each of the 16 projects of CIMTAN."

Quantifying the Capture and Conversion Efficiencies of Species Being Considered for Organic Extraction in Open-Water IMTA Systems		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), University of Victoria (UVic), Vancouver Island University (VIU), University of British Columbia (UBC), University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ), Vancouver Aquarium, Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.
"	"This project assessed the capability of different invertebrate species to capture, absorb, and convert particulate fish-farm waste into new production. On the east coast, Blue Mussels (Mytilus edulis) were capable of ingesting and efficiently absorbing small organic material from both fish food and faeces. After a variety of feeding trials using artificial diets in the laboratory and natural particles at IMTA sites, we determined that the Orange-Footed Sea Cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) could also efficiently extract larger organic material from farm waste. Biodeposition techniques and flume feeding trials revealed that C. frondosa fed equally among all particle sizes monitored (200-1200 ?m) but rates of clearance in the field (7.2 L day-1) were relatively low compared to other species being considered for mitigation. On the west coast, species assessed for extractive capabilities include filter feeders such as Basket Cockles (Clinocardium nuttallii) and Blue Mussels (M. edulis), as well as deposit feeders such as Green Sea Urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), California Sea Cucumbers (Parastichopus californicus), and Pacific Prawns (Pandalus platyceros). Green Sea Urchins and California Sea Cucumbers ingest and absorb Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) faeces at rates comparable to or higher than those for traditional diets such as kelps and natural sediment, respectively. This research has enabled the assessment of nutritional responses for a variety of shellfish and deposit-feeder species on diets of fish-farm organics, thereby providing crucial insight into co-cultured species selection and IMTA system efficiency.

Loma salmonae: A Microsporidian Model to Help Assess Transmission Dynamics to Pathogens within an IMTA Setting		University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI)	"Our goal has been to modify an infection model for the microsporidian pathogen Loma salmonae, and use this model to evaluate the role that Blue Mussels may have in extracting environmentally released spores within an IMTA setting. Specifically, asking the question of whether Blue Mussels may serve to mitigate disease transmission by deactivating spores that they encounter during feeding. The model has been successfully developed and now allows us to modify various environmental and temporal parameters. A very useful and unexpected outcome was the establishment of L. salmonae within cell culture. This advance will allow far greater flexibility in our studies, both as a tool for producing spores, but also for detecting them within environmental niches under study. To date, we have determined that Blue Mussels are very effective in extracting microsporidial spores from the environment; spores are subsequently released in pseudofeces, or feces, and small proportion of them stored for several weeks within mussel viscera. Spores are not rendered defective whether they are retained, or passed within egesta; in vitro tests of spore viability have been evaluated against the gold standard in vivo measures of infectivity. The introduction of a bivalve component alongside a salmon growing operation may provide beneficial disease reduction services. A greater understanding of disease dynamics between trophic levels is a key part of health management within integrated settings."

Cultivation of Complementary Inorganic Extractive Species for Increased System Performance		University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.	"This project investigates the red alga Palmaria palmata (Dulse) for increased inorganic biomitigation of IMTA systems when kelps are not present at the sites. Large-scale cultivation of this species has been hampered by a complex life history, in which P. palmata alternates between sexual (with macroscopic male and microscopic female gametophytes) and asexual (with macroscopic tetrasporophytes) reproduction. One of the current challenges is that male gametophytes are indistinguishable from tetrasporophytes by conventional microscopy when they are not reproductive. We took two approaches (molecular and spectroscopic) to make identification easier. We designed and tested primers to target DNA in an intron region in an actin gene that is expressed in tetrasporophytes, but not in males, in an attempt to identify a sex-linked molecular marker, however, the intron region showed no difference. Individual ratios, or combinations of ratios, of spectral bands obtained by Raman and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy allowed for classification between male gametophytes and tetrasporophytes. The cultivation of P. palmata in the laboratory has progressed (design and testing of new substrates/panels; increased light irradiance and photoperiod). The best timing of transfer to the sites remains to be better understood to reduce biofouling. The cultivation, harvesting, and processing of the two kelps (Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta) continue to be improved. They have continuously been organically certified since 2014. The project is also looking at the development of appropriate and efficient regulations for seaweeds and the management of inorganic nutrient loading, within an integrated coastal area management strategy and scale. This research has developed a better understanding of the issues related to the management of the inorganic load from aquaculture operations. It has highlighted the ecosystem functions and services provided by the inorganic extractive component of IMTA. It has brought understanding to the need to consider IMTA within the context of an integrated coastal area management strategy. Integration should be understood as cultivation in proximity, not considering absolute distances but connectivity in terms of ecosystemic functionalities, which means that entire bays/coastal areas/regions could be the units of IMTA management."

Quantifying the Role of Microbes in the Nutrient Recycling of Organic Material from IMTA Sites		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ)	"Understanding the various paths and processes by which energy flows through an IMTA site is one of the main objectives in the creation of sustainable aquaculture systems using ecosystem-based approaches. As food from one trophic level is recycled through another, the energy associated with the organic particles is stripped out and is converted to inorganic waste products such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, or heat. This transfer process occurs between all trophic levels right down to the lowest where the bacteria and other microbes reside. The objective of this project was to evaluate and quantify the role that bacteria play in nutrient recycling at a salmon aquaculture site and to evaluate the relative scale of their ability to convert organic particles into inorganic components. Specifically, we enumerated bacteria and their respiration rates on and away from finfish aquaculture farms in both the water column and the benthos on a seasonal basis at IMTA sites in the Bay of Fundy. Additionally, we identified prominent members of the benthic and pelagic bacterial communities associated with the aquaculture sites and how they varied with depth, distance, and time. The results are demonstrating that these non-pathogenic bacteria are playing a very large role in carbon conversion on a farm lease and should be considered in the design of aquaculture sites in the future. This information is also contributing to a model being prepared on energy flow through an IMTA site. This research provided insight into the role heterotrophic bacteria are playing in the recycling of organic wastes near salmon aquaculture farms. This will provide much needed guidance on what the carrying capacity is for benthic and pelagic microbes to convert organic carbon which will have direct implications on feeding rates of the fish and time required for fallowing the site after a production cycle. The research may also provide insights on what proactive measures might be taken before fish production starts.

Quantifying Energy and Nutrient Dispersal and Scales of Influence on Wild Species from Open-Water IMTA Sites		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.	"This research, on methods to quantify the effect of mid-water nutrients in wild species, revealed that site-specific hydrographic conditions are critical components for colonization, growth, and quality of many nutrient extracting wild species that inhabit the coastal zone near aquaculture farms. One approach has been to sample wild species biocolonization to measure changes in diversity and growth in the “near-field” and “far-field”. This revealed that introduced habitats placed near and far from aquaculture sites attract very different species rather than altered growth of any one dominant organism. Differences in mid-water physical environment and the presence of appropriate habitat substrates, from cage structure or coastal topography, are as important to wild species colonization as the availability of nutrients alone. Another approach has sought to measure changing colour characteristics of wild algal species as a proxy to current analytical laboratory techniques to measure nitrogen concentrations in the water column or nitrogen content in algal tissues. Several species of naturally occurring algae (some of which may also be commercially important) exhibited changes in colour characteristics throughout their growing season. Within a relatively confined geographic location and season, the relationship between colour and tissue nutrient content (% nitrogen) is small. However, differences in colour and the relationship with % nitrogen is more pronounced among different locations and time periods and could be a potential tool to monitor changes in nutrient availability on a larger scale. This is key information to support the design of IMTA sites using nutrient extracting species, as well as to understand IMTA performance measures for those species integrated for the purpose of extracting aquaculture-related nutrients."

"Can Filter-Feeding Bivalves Ingest Planktonic Sea Lice, Leading to Reduced Sea Lice Numbers on Cultivated Salmon?"		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of Victoria (UVic); Vancouver Island University (VIU); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Limited	"The close proximity of salmon farms and wild Pacific salmon stocks in British Columbia (BC) is an important incentive for precautionary, environmentally-friendly sea lice management strategies. A field trial was conducted to determine whether IMTA filter-feeding bivalves can provide preventative, natural sea louse control by ingesting sea lice larvae (nauplii and copepodids) from the water column; a system that exploits the sea louse life cycle and the natural filtration capabilities of bivalves. Pacific Oysters, one of several bivalve species that consumed sea lice larvae in previous laboratory experiments, were grown at a commercial Atlantic Salmon farm in BC for 13 months. The 30,000 experimental oysters were deployed in trays at 1, 3, and 6 m around one end of the farm’s 2x7 square-cage array, and at a nearby reference site. Bivalve growth (both shell size and tissue biomass) was significantly affected by depth and side of the fish cage. Oysters from select sides were consistently, significantly larger than those from other sides and from the reference site. Sea lice mitigation by oysters was assessed by comparing monthly sea lice larval densities inside bivalve and non-bivalve fish cages, and by analyzing preserved oyster digestive tracts for presence of sea lice DNA. Using these methods, no significant evidence of sea lice mitigation was detected. Planktonic sea lice densities inside of the cages were low (typically < 1 m-3), and sea louse mitigation by bivalves may, therefore, require the larvae be concentrated using light or other means and/or the strategic placement of a higher density of bivalves. The development of non-chemical sea lice mitigation techniques, such as IMTA filter-feeding bivalves, may help improve the environmental, social, and economic performance of salmon farms.

"Presence, Effect, and Bioaccumulation of Therapeutants in Polychaetes"		University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; 	"Ecto-parasites are common on Atlantic Salmon under cage culture conditions. Severe infestations require treatment with drugs and pesticides. Considerable research has been conducted to assess the risk of these compounds to non-target species, mostly focusing on indigenous species of known commercial or ecological value. In this project, the non-target species of interest is one being considered as a co-cultured species in an IMTA setting, the Sand Worm Nereis virens. As a co-cultured species, the worms would be exposed to compounds during routine anti-parasitic treatments. Worms were exposed, in treated water, sediment, or sand, to one drug (Slice®, active ingredient emamectin benzoate (EB)) and one pesticide (AlphaMax®, active ingredient deltamethrin). Survival was monitored, as well as sublethal indicators of “wellness”. Worms exposed to Slice® survived exposure to environmentally-relevant concentrations (~360 ?g/kg dry sand) of the product; however, in 30-day studies worms stopped burrowing in the treated substrate and showed signs of poor condition including loss of weight. Worms exposed to AlphaMax® died at concentrations well above the recommended dose, but survived exposures in sediment. Worms exposed to as little as 11 ?g/g of wet sediment in 30-day trials stopped burrowing and showed poor condition, including loss of weight. Anti-sea louse treatment could be hazardous to N. virens; however, in the absence of data regarding concentrations of EB or deltamethrin near cage sites, it is difficult to assess the potential risk to cultured worms. While the two anti-sea louse products are not particularly lethal to N. virens, worms were affected by exposure to these products and results indicate that anti-sea louse treatments have the potential to negatively affect this species. These negative effects could affect the suitability of this species to be co-cultured in IMTA.

Mathematical Modelling for Open-Water IMTA: Developing Tools to Support System Design and Measures of Sustainability		University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of Guelph (U Guelph); Cooke Aquaculture Inc. 	"This project aimed to quantify efficiency of nutrient recovery and augmented growth in open-water IMTA systems. One study explored the seaweed biomass required to remove soluble nutrients from salmon culture. The mean weight ratios of the seaweeds Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima required to sequester all soluble nutrients excreted per unit weight of salmon range from 4:1 to 13:1, depending on the nutrient. Another study reported the proportion of fish farm solids ingested by mussels needed to reduce site-wide organic loading at an IMTA site, which ranged between 10% and 20%. A third study suggested the biomitigation potential of mussels will be greatest where seston abundance is low, organic dietary content high, and that achieving maximal waste extraction by mussel co-culture entails food particle depletion that may limit mussel production. Commercial Sablefish growth and nutrient loading were also modelled. Results suggested that the predicted peak nutrient loading in year two of production was only 1.7 times greater than the peak loading in year one, less than half the annual loading difference reported for cultured Atlantic Salmon. The slower relative growth rate of large Sablefish reduces the discrepancies between annual peak loading periods, enabling better matches of co-cultured species biomass with nutrient supply compared to more rapidly growing fish. Some field data were recently combined with Norwegian field data to publish a report on discrete water quality sampling at open-water aquaculture sites, their limitations and recommended strategies. Finally, project results are providing valuable inputs for an IMTA bio-economic model under development. This work has led to a better understanding of overall system efficiencies and has guided the effective development of open-water IMTA farms, through such mechanisms as the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat review process to support policy development and management for Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

Evaluating the Performance of Proposed and Existing IMTA Sites Using an Ecosystem Modelling Approach		Dalhousie University (Dalhousie U); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.	"Maximizing the mitigation potential of open-water finfish-shellfish IMTA farms is complex in terms of co-locating the trophic components. Both the dispersal of finfish aquaculture wastes and biological processes are highly influenced by water circulation. Consequently, the evaluation of shellfish-finfish synergy requires a combined study of biological and physical processes, which can be achieved by the implementation and coupling of mathematical models. In the context of this project, a highly configurable mathematical model that can be applied at the apparent spatial scale of IMTA sites has been developed. The model tracks different components of the seston, including feed wastes, fish faeces, shellfish faeces, natural detritus, and phytoplankton. Based on the specific characterization of these fluxes to local conditions, the model can be used to explore different spatial arrangements of IMTA farms for evaluating finfish-shellfish farm mitigation efficiency. A hypothetical IMTA site was used as a testing ground of the model to explore mitigation efficiency under a broad range of environmental conditions and farm arrangements. The model predicts that: (1) mitigation efficiency is highly dependent on the background environmental conditions, obtaining maximal mitigation under oligotrophic conditions that stimulate shellfish filtration activity; (2) the dominance of vertical fluxes of particulate matter triggered by the high settling velocity of finfish aquaculture wastes suggests that suspended shellfish aquaculture cannot significantly reduce organic loading of the seabed; and consequently, (3) waste mitigation at IMTA sites should be best achieved by placing organic extractive species (e.g., deposit feeders) on the seabed directly beneath finfish cages rather than in suspension in the water column."

Initial project work utilized the Finite-Volume primitive equation Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to model localized currents around an IMTA site in Kyuquot Sound, Vancouver Island, to explore influences at the bay-scale. This was followed by the development of 1:15 scale model cage-arrays, which were deployed in the Flume Tank facility at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Current meters measured wake, velocity, and turbulence around circular and square aquaculture cage-arrays, deployed in common configurations used on the west and east coasts. Dye release studies showed how flow fields in and around cages behaved within and down-stream from the array. Results quantified large velocity deficits in cages wakes, flow forcing around and below cages, and unsteadiness of large scale turbulence in array wakes. The dye release data agree well with wake velocity measurements.

"A Variation on the IMTA Theme for Land-Based, Freshwater Aquaculture Operations: The Development of Freshwater IMTA (FIMTA) for Salmon and Aquaponic Plants"		University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.	"Freshwater IMTA (FIMTA) applies the same principles as those used in marine IMTA, but in a freshwater setting. Aquaponics is a form of FIMTA that combines animal aquaculture and plant culture, through a microbial link and in a symbiotic relationship. Wastes produced from the fish are either absorbed directly by the plants or converted by microbes and then consumed by the plants. The development of our FIMTA system involved a two-part investigation. The first part was to identify a suitable freshwater salmon hatchery. This was done with routine water testing at a number of sampling locations within eight hatcheries (4 flow-through and 4 recirculating). The data were used to select a hatchery for further development and to also create a software program that can be used by hatchery managers to quickly identify inadequacies in their water treatment systems and effluent discharge. The second part of the investigation was to collect effluent water from the selected hatchery and use it in a temperature and light controlled pilot-scale FIMTA/aquaponic system to test potential plant species in terms of growth and nutrient removal capabilities. Biochar produced from IMTA grown kelps was used as a substrate. A total of 13 plant species were tested at temperatures of 10-15°C, as this is the optimal water temperature range for growing salmon in freshwater hatcheries. The ability of the system to remove nutrients from the collected salmon effluent varied depending on the species selected and the biomass they produced, as well as the variability of nutrient levels in the collected effluent. The analyses indicated that recirculating hatcheries are more valuable candidates for FIMTA systems than conventional flow-through hatcheries. The development of FIMTA for commercial salmon hatcheries will aid in the completion of IMTA from egg to plate. Not only can this be useful for branding purposes, but it can also aid farmers in waste reduction, increased water reuse, increased product diversification, and improvement of societal acceptance of the industry. In particular, reducing phosphorus levels in effluents can help farmers meet water quality guidelines and prevent eutrophication in the environment. IMTA and FIMTA are included in the Canadian Organic Aquaculture Standard.

Spatial and Temporal Particulate Dynamics and Their Influence on Update Species Placement at an IMTA Site		University of Victoria (UVic); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.	"Environmental concerns about the location of open-water aquaculture sites are based on issues such as organic wastes, primarily made up of uneaten feed and fecal material. IMTA can potentially minimize this issue by placing species that capture the produced organic matter. The main goal of this project was to investigate the open-water daily temporal and vertical dispersal of waste particles for better defining the placement of extractive species and the required background environmental conditions at an IMTA site on the west coast of Vancouver Island. We conducted in situ measurements, before and after fish feeding, of bio-optical properties, such as particle light scattering and backscattering as proxies for organic particle concentrations, and particulate backscattering ratio and estimated particle index of refraction as indicators of particle compositions, along with discrete measurements of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) derived pigments and particulate organic carbon, within and beside a finfish cage in the autumn, spring, and summer. During autumn, lower-cage post feeding optical measurements suggest the dominance of large particles with high indices of refraction, possibly due to the influence of fish fecal particles. Optical variability in spring was driven by diatom bloom conditions (Chaetoceros and Skeletonema) with the optical proxies suggesting dominance by large particles with low indices of refraction. Summer conditions displayed noticeably high and persistent particulate backscattering in surface waters, suggesting the presence of an Emiliania huxleyi bloom. Optical characterization of particulate waste dispersal is constrained to low ambient seston conditions, and would be beneficial for environmental monitoring of ambient particles moving through aquaculture systems. Tracking and quantifying particulate wastes in these sites generally relies on time consuming, expensive, and low temporal and spatial resolution discrete sampling methods. We utilized in situ bio-optical sensors to collect data at high temporal and vertical resolutions to track particulates within and beside a finfish aquaculture cage.

Design and Demonstration of a Renewable Energy System Powering an IMTA Site		University of Victoria (UVic); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.	"IMTA aims to reduce the environmental impacts of seafood production. However, as most sites are quite remote, diesel fuel is the primary fuel but is clearly non-sustainable from climate change and fuel spill risk perspectives. This project demonstrated a renewable energy system starting with a detailed assessment of the solar, wind, tidal, and wave resources on-site along with the loads associated with dockside operations (primarily for extractive species hoists). The site is purposely sheltered from the open sea, and therefore only solar was found to be viable, although this is likely different at other IMTA sites. A solar-battery system was optimized with particular emphasis on fine-grained temporal resolution to ensure the peak loads, as well as average energy, were satisfied throughout the year. Diesel genset back-up was also considered alongside full battery systems. Mounting of the solar panels and battery bank was also investigated on-board the dockside tram and in stationary locations on the docks. In the end, a system with genset backup was found to be most cost effective to meet extreme power loads in case of protracted low solar irradiation during winter. The system has been installed on site for long term in situ testing and validation of the design, and the modeling tool is available for optimizing such renewable energy systems at other IMTA sites. Renewable energy provision on site is both viable and critical to achieving truly sustainable operations by avoiding the burning of fossil fuel, as well as associated environmental contamination risks of spills. This project developed a tool for designing such systems and implemented a field demonstration of the system components.

Optimizing IMTA Species Components Stocking Densities and Infrastructure Orientation to Maximize Overall System Efficiency		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); University of Victoria (UVic); Vancouver Island University (VIU); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Effingham Oysters Ltd.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.	"To improve the sustainability of IMTA systems, extractive species stocking densities and infrastructure orientations need to be optimised such that they maximise the interception of excess fish-farm nutrients and IMTA efficiency. In order to achieve this objective, the dynamics of nutrient transfer within the site needs to be understood to choose the best configuration and species mix. On the east coast, empirical studies were done on flow patterns and organic particle dilution rates and their potential utilization by farmed and wild species was studied on conventional and IMTA salmon sites to provide input on a model for site efficiency. Results indicated substantial spatial and temporal variation in flows around the farm. On the west coast, the project was focused on optimizing the benthic extraction of nutrients within an IMTA system using the detritus-feeding California Sea Cucumber, Parastichopus californicus. The California Sea Cucumber has been established as a promising candidate for IMTA due to its ability to extract benthic nutrients and its high market value. This study confirmed the potential for cultivation of juvenile P. californicus within suspended trays of an IMTA system. The results of a six-month field trial indicated a positive effect of co-culture with oysters with greater food availability and higher containment success compared to a control site 320 m away. In examining different suspended tray designs, we determined that reduced food availability increases the occurrence of visceral atrophy, reduces sea cucumber growth, and decreases overall IMTA system nutrient recycling efficiency. A trade-off between containment and food availability was found for the co-cultured sea cucumbers. Expanding our knowledge of nutrient transfer within current IMTA site designs will help the industry develop their infrastructure and also provide inputs into future designs of aquaculture farms. These studies will also contribute to the understanding of the risk of various materials advecting away from the farm point-source in relation to the dilution rates. Expanding our knowledge of P. californicus as a benthic extractive species within IMTA systems and addressing issues such as containment of this species will be mutually beneficial to resource managers and industry partners."

Economic Implications of IMTA		Simon Fraser University (SFU)	"Our research has addressed key economic aspects of the aquaculture commercialization process in Canada, namely benefits for consumers of aquaculture products and society at large, as well as potential producer benefits. In the first case, extensive household surveying in the major consuming region (west coast, USA) demonstrated a clear willingness to pay more for IMTA products (e.g., salmon, shellfish)–averaging 9% more for IMTA versus conventional farmed salmon. Salmon consumers were also willing to pay more for IMTA products versus those from closed containment aquaculture (CCA). The reverse was true in the producing region (British Columbia, Canada) when the general public was asked about their willingness to pay to support the development of IMTA versus CCA: CCA attracted greater levels of support. In general, preferences for IMTA were stronger in the USA than in Canada (see figure attached), while preferences for CCA were stronger in Canada than in the USA, where a small segment of consumers actually see CCA negatively. On the producer side, the results are only just emerging. Earlier economic studies suggested IMTA is more profitable than conventional salmon farming. But if this is true, why has it not been adopted more extensively? Earlier studies likely underestimated the added costs of IMTA production, such as the extra management costs and risk associated with a more complex production system. We are carrying out more rigorous modelling to factor in real world constraints, such as effluent standards and site licensing limits, and to investigate policy tools to promote IMTA. Our main impact will be on how policymakers respond to the problems associated with monoculture salmon farming and on how to help assess the role IMTA should play in the process. This can influence the design of programs and incentives to help the industry better align its activities to benefit society."

Social Implications of IMTA: Coastal Communities and the Appetite for Aquaculture		University of Victoria (UVic); Vancouver Island University (VIU)	"Our work has continued along the tenets of social license and perceptions of IMTA in Canada. In 2015, we co-hosted information workshops where an exchange of dialogue and knowledge explored the particular and nuanced interests of British Columbia First Nations communities. Building on this work we sought to further explore perceptions of IMTA amongst coastal communities of the west and east coasts of Canada, and to situate these perceptions amongst finfish, shellfish, and seaweed aquaculture, as well as seafood consumption and purchase preferences. Survey teams were dispatched to the small coastal communities (populations < 5,000 inhabitants) of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and to the Maritime communities along the coast of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Together, the teams collected 657 survey interviews. Preliminary findings indicate significant differences in awareness of aquaculture and in perceptions, and between the two coasts. The overall response to IMTA was favourable. In British Columbia and the Maritimes, the majority of respondents thought the government should encourage the present finfish aquaculture industry to adopt IMTA methods (54% and 71%, respectively), and over 65% of respondents from both coasts would support the development of new aquaculture farms based on the IMTA production system. Notably, 44% of British Columbia respondents and 35% of east coast respondents said they would pay more for products certified as IMTA; however, almost half of all respondents also identified that they do not purchase farmed seafood, citing their ability to access and obtain wild seafood through personal means or social networks. Our research indicates that the adaptability of the IMTA system is its greatest asset in its future development. Different interest groups will express different values in the design, scale and operations of a system amidst a variegated geographic and often contentious political landscape that has characterized much of Canada’s aquaculture development. In the new era of participatory governance, the undermining or absence of including significant interest groups may pre-emptively determine the future of IMTA development."

"Developing an Ecological Carrying Capacity for Shellfish Aquaculture in Baynes Sound, British Columbia"		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); BC Shellfish Growers Association; Mac’s Oysters Ltd.; Hollie Wood Oysters Ltd.	"In British Columbia (BC), shellfish culture is located primarily on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia, with the most prolific production sites associated with Baynes Sound, Cortez Island, and Okeover Inlet. Although the culture of shellfish was developed over 100 years ago in BC, little research exists pertaining to the ecological capacity of shellfish production in these prolific, sheltered bays. Shellfish production is influenced by a balance of water quality, hydrodynamics (bay flushing), and food supply (plankton). A carrying capacity assessment is required to assess this balance and identify any bay-wide limitations due to a potential competition for resources or shift in ecosystem functioning. A high-resolution, spatially-explicit hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model [e.g., Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM)–Bivalve Culture Ecosystem Model] is being developed to assess the ecological carrying capacity of shellfish aquaculture in Baynes Sound. These mathematical models, groundtruthed with local data, will integrate the complex interactions among aquaculture activities, shellfish physiology, and the ecosystem.

(BCSGA); Little Wing Oysters; Okeover Organic Oysters; Sawmill Bay Shellfish; Taylor Shellfish; Stellar Bay Shellfish; Evening Cove Oysters; Nanoose Bay Oysters"	"Microplastics (i.e., plastics < 5 mm) are an emerging contaminant of increasing concern to industry, scientists, and the general public. Microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment and come from a wide range of sources including sewage effluent and general degradation of larger plastics. There are several types of microplastics such as microbeads, fibres, and fragments which are ingested by a wide range of organisms. Ingestion of microplastics can have negative physical and chemical impacts on the organisms that consume them. Because of this, the aquaculture industry has the potential to be negatively affected by microplastic pollution. Conversely, because of the use of plastics in the aquaculture industry there is also the potential to contribute to microplastic pollution. To address these issues, we are conducting a collaborative study with VIU, DFO, BCSGA, Vancouver Aquarium, and UVic. This research will: 
1) determine the concentration of microplastics in clams and oysters cultured in coastal British Columbia; 
2) determine the concentration of microplastics in the surrounding environment; 
3) characterize the type of microplastics found and identify potential sources;
4) evaluate depuration as a potentialmechanism to eliminate microplastics;and 5) investigate the impact of microplastics on shellfish health and resilience. This research will show the level of microplastic pollution within commercial shellfish and their surrounding environment. It will also indicate the efficacy of depuration to remove this contaminant, the implications of microplastic ingestion on shellfish health, and potential microplastic sources.

"Science-Industry Partnership Leading to a Better Understanding of Ocean Acidification in British Columbia, Canada"		Hakai Institute; Sawmill Bay Shellfish Co.	"The goal of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of Ocean Acidification (OA) parameters at two sites in the northern Salish Sea; one being a continuous monitoring system at a research station and the other being a partnering local shellfish producer’s farm site. Increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake by the surface ocean is driving a reduction in oceanic pH. This acidification alters the carbonate chemistry of the seawater, decreasing the saturation state of carbonate minerals essential to shellforming organisms. Consequently, OA will have major implications for the shellfish aquaculture industry in the long-term. Currently, key information is lacking for coastal settings, hindering identification of near-term effects. It is critical to monitor coastal areas to determine the current status and plan mitigation strategies for the impact of increasing OA on the shellfish industry. In this study, weekly OA samples were collected at the farm site and compared them with the high resolution data collected at the research station. Preliminary analyses reveal two important features: 
1) OA signals are coherent across both sites, suggesting that they are influenced by similar processes and that broadcast high resolution data available on a public web portal (Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network data portal: http://portal.goa-on.org/ Explorer?action=oiw:fixed_platform:HAKAI_ Quadra1) is an important diagnostic for the industry partner; and 
2) the OA data fluctuated across a large range between sampling events at the farm site indicating the importance of short time scale variability in setting conditions. The information produced in this study demonstrates the critical importance of science-industry partnerships for filling the extensive OA data gap present in coastal settings. Ultimately the information garnered by studies like this will aid in the development of adaptation strategies for the regional impacts of this significant global problem.

The Development of an FVCOM Hydrodynamic Model to Support Aquaculture on the West Coast of Vancouver Island 		"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Cermaq Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.
"	"Previous hydrodynamic modelling in the Broughton Archipelago and the Discovery Islands has demonstrated the advantage of having a computer (numerical) model that provides accurate three dimensional information on current flow, temperature, and salinity. FVCOM (Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model), when fully developed for this area, promises to provide accurate 3D information. Since FVCOM’s development process is complex, this research project is using existing information and new data collected specifically for this project in order to further develop the model. The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to apply the accurate FVCOM 3D information to examine particle tracking, virus dispersion, and sea lice behaviour in the waters off the West Coast of Vancouver Island in and around aquaculture sites in the area. The results of this project (the developed model) will be important for the sustainable management of the aquaculture industry. The data will inform mitigation actions that can be recommended by management bodies in response to well characterized risk. From an industry perspective, these results can inform best management practices in order to offset possible impacts.

Benthic Culture of Sea Cucumbers: Assessing Interactions Between Cultured and Wild Populations and the Mitigation of Environmental Impacts in Shellfish Co-Culture		Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of British Columbia (UBC); Fan Seafoods Ltd.; Klahoose First Nation; Pacific Sea Cucumbers Harvesters Association; Viking Bay Ventures	"High market demand has resulted in a great deal of interest in culturing the California Sea Cucumber (Parastichopus californicus) in British Columbia (BC). However, before these operations can proceed to full scale production, additional base-line data are needed to determine the viability and potential impacts of culturing sea cucumbers. The primary aims of this project are to determine: 1) the growth and survival of sea cucumbers in benthic culture; 2) the environmental impact of sea cucumber aquaculture; and 3) the potential interactions between wild and benthic-ranched individuals. The results of this project show promise for the development of sea cucumber aquaculture in BC. Juveniles have shown good growth and survival when raised in benthic cages both on and away from an existing deep-water oyster farm. When co-cultured with oysters, the nutrient rich benthic habitat at these sites may allow for higher growth rates and stocking densities. High densities of sea cucumbers often found at existing aquaculture sites may help to ameliorate some of the nutrient loading and associated environmental impacts of shellfish aquaculture. However, seasonal changes in sea cucumber density at our study site suggest that if preventing mixing of wild and cultured stocks is desired, some form of containment may be necessary. Expanding our knowledge of benthic ranching techniques for P. californicus and addressing issues such as containment of this species will be mutually beneficial to resource managers and industry partners.
