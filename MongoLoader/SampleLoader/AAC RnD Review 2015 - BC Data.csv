META-ANALYSIS OF FRESHWATER AQUACULTURE PROVINCIAL WATER QUALITY MONITORING DATA,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO),"Recent increases in production capacity in Ontario, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have prompted regulators to consider strategies for managing freshwater finfish aquaculture, in particular, ecosystem carrying capacity which is tightly coupled with the phosphorus released in aquaculture waste. Currently in Ontario, a water quality monitoring program is imposed as a condition to aquaculture licenses to ensure that the release of phosphorus from finfish farms does not exceed regulatory thresholds. The program, however, does not address phosphorus levels near or downstream from freshwater finfish farms, or if phosphorus concentrations have increased over the decade that sampling has been conducted. One of the primary environmental concerns restricting the expansion of the freshwater finfish cage industry is the ability of the environment to assimilate waste, in particular phosphorus. Phosphorus is the nutrient that limits the biomass of primary producers; excessive amounts of phosphorus released from aquaculture cages pose a risk of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems. A decade of water monitoring data collected through the historic Ontario monitoring program will be analyzed to determine if there is evidence that freshwater finfish cages are contributing to elevated phosphorus concentrations and to the eutrophication in the environment. Given the link between assimilation of phosphorus and carrying capacity, the results of this project will provide further insight to the role of ecosystem carrying capacity in accommodating sustainable expansion of the industry.

MIGRATION TIMING AND DISTRIBUTION OF JUVENILE SALMON IN DISCOVERY ISLANDS AND JOHNSTONE STRAIT,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Inc.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Cermaq Canada,"This research will help explain how juvenile salmon utilize the Strait of Georgia, including the Discovery Islands area, with a focus on Fraser River Sockeye Salmon and to a lesser extent, Chinook Salmon. It will also provide the information required to fully assess the risks of disease transfer from salmon farms to the wild, understand the potential consequences of such transfers, and inform farm management policies. Purse seines and DFO trawl surveys have greatly increased the understanding of the migration and health of juvenile salmon within the Strait of Georgia, BC, especially for Sockeye Salmon. Surveys conducted in 2010–2012 revealed that Fraser River Sockeye Salmon do not enter the Discovery Islands area (a fish farming area) until the end of May, and that they are widely distributed throughout this area for at least part of June. To further assess risks associated with interactions between farmed and wild fish, information in the following key areas is needed:  
(1) Knowledge of migratory pathways of salmon and the duration of their residency in the vicinity of fish farms;
(2) Knowledge of the prevalence of pathogens and diseases within wild and farmed populations; and 
(3) Knowledge of environmental and host conditions during the periods wild salmon reside in the vicinity of fish farms. Additionally, more information is required to further understand when and for how long juvenile salmon are present in the vicinity of fish farms, as well as to describe migration timing of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon out of the Strait of Georgia. To gain this required information, sampling will be performed using a three-year trawl survey in the Strait of Georgia and a three-year purse seine combined with hydroacoustic surveys in Johnstone Strait.

ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BLUE LED LIGHTS USED AT MARINE FINFISH AQUACULTURE SITES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA ,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.,"The use of artificial lighting within finfish aquaculture operations is a common technique used to delay sexual maturation and produce larger fish. Currently, finfish growers in British Columbia are interested in exploring the use of blue light emitting diode (LED) lights. These blue LED lights are more efficient, use less energy, and last longer than the traditionally used white metal halide lights, making them an attractive, economical choice. However, artificial lighting may affect both the diversity and abundance of the native organisms surrounding an aquaculture site, and this study evaluated these potential effects. The use of blue LED lights at an experimental site at night was found to attract fish and zooplankton, when compared to unlit controls. No statistical difference was observed for phytoplankton abundance (in the absence of blooms) or the settlement of benthic invertebrates between blue LED lights and controls. A commercial finfish site was also equipped with blue LED lights to determine their effects on fish maturation, growth, and sea lice counts in comparison to a site equipped with traditional white halide lights. There was no statistical difference in sea lice counts between farm sites equipped with blue LED lights or white halide lights, but direct comparisons were difficult. The results of this project have led to an increased understanding of the effects of blue LED lights on the native biota, but continued research is necessary in order to determine the effects and implications of blue LED lights directly at an aquaculture site. This information will allow both industry and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to continue to support the sustainable development of finfish operations in British Columbia, and better manage the intricate relationship between aquaculture and the environment.",APR. 2011,DEC . 2013,DFO – Aquaculture Collaborative Research and Development Program (DFO – ACRDP); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.,Hannah Stewart (DFO); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.,Aquaculture - Finfish
ASSESSING SENSITIVITY TO EMAMECTIN BENZOATE (SLICE®) IN SEA LICE LEPEOPHTHEIRUS SALMONIS FROM FARMED ATLANTIC SALMON IN BRITISH COLUMBIA,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Inc.,"As this research is the first effort to document sub-lethal effects of emamectin benzoate (SLICE®), a commonly used sea lice treatment. The results of this project will contribute to both increased knowledge and improved disease management strategies to help minimize the impacts of pathogens on farmed salmon. Infestation with sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a significant economic burden to commercial salmon aquaculture. While there are a range of sea lice control strategies, in-feed emamectin benzoate (known commercially as SLICE®) is the treatment of choice for sea lice on farmed Atlantic Salmon because of its high efficacy and ease of application. However, recent treatment failures have been linked to resistance to SLICE® within sea lice populations. While in vitro data support the conclusion that sea lice in British Columbia remain sensitive to SLICE®, treatment efficacy is variable among sites. Sublethal effects of SLICE® are poorly documented and if this treatment is to remain an effective management strategy, it is important to determine its effects on treatment survivors and on sea lice prior to mortality. This project will attempt to forward that knowledge by: (1) assessing the hatch rate, developmental rate, and viability of cultured larval sea lice (L. salmonis); (2) generating first generation (F1 generation) sea lice to permit comparative assessments of SLICE® sensitivity with parental sea lice; and (3) performing biological assessments to determine the SLICE® sensitivity of parental and F1 generation sea lice, pre- and post-treatment, from each of three salmon production sites.

MONITORING AND MODELLING OF SEA LICE INTERACTION WITH WILD AND FARMED SALMON IN THE BROUGHTON ARCHIPELAGO,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada; Grieg Seafood BC; Mainstream Canada,"This project has helped to improve our understanding of the interactions of sea lice with wild and farmed fish. The results of this research will help inform decisions on the siting and management of finfish aquaculture sites in BC and support the long term health of wild fish populations and the fish farm industry. The interaction of sea lice with farmed salmon and wild salmon has been the focus of international concern for at least a decade. Health and growth performance issues associated with sea lice infestations continue to be a significant concern for the salmon farming industry globally, driving the implementation of preventative measures in areas where there is the threat of infestation. This project developed a predictive model of the distribution of sea lice originating from fish farms and estimated the number of encounters of out-migrating salmon with sea lice. It also established statistically robust models to capture associations between the sea lice burden on wild fish and conditions on BC fish farms. Modelling was used to associate factors such as year, month, type of seine gear used, fish species, and fish length to the presence of sea lice on wild chum and pink salmon. Using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software, trajectory maps (maps which show the direction and distance of particle movement) and particle density maps were generated for fish farm locations in the Broughton, as well as corresponding fish farm connectivity tables (tables which describe the overlap of particle exchange between farms).

SEA LICE INFECTION LEVELS ON JUVENILE SALMON DURING EARLY SEAWATER RESIDENCY AND MIGRATION OUT OF THE STRAIT OF GEORGIA,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO),"There have been reports that suggest the poor returns of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon could be caused by infections with sea lice acquired from salmon farms during their northern migration from the Strait of Georgia. To determine the potential impact, if any, from salmon farms, background information is needed about the species of sea lice that are present and their numbers on juvenile salmon and non-salmonid hosts. This multi-year project involved sampling of juvenile salmonids and non-salmonids for sea lice during the out migration period. Samples were collected from numerous sites throughout the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait to examine the role that salmon farms may play as a source of sea lice infections on wild fish. Prevalence and abundance of the different sea lice species and their developmental stages were determined. Samples of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye are also examined for the presence of other pathogens and disease. This project provides valuable information on: 
(1) the species composition and abundance of sea lice in these areas; 
(2) when and where fish become infected with sea lice; 
(3) whether patterns of sea lice infection vary among years; and 
(4) the overall health status of juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon.

THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE AND REPEAT LEPEOPHTHEIRUS SALMONIS (SEA LICE) INFECTIONS ON THE HEALTH OF JUVENILE PACIFIC SALMON,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO),"There is evidence that different species of Pacific salmon differ in their susceptibility to infections with the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, under laboratory conditions. For example, Pink and Coho Salmon have been shown to be less susceptible to sea lice infections than Chinook or Chum Salmon. This multi-year project examined the susceptibility and lethal infection level of juvenile Sockeye, Coho, and Chum Salmon to L. salmonis. In addition, the effects of previous exposure to L. salmonis on susceptibility to infection and the physiological and immunological responses were determined for these species. The project provides managers with tools to help evaluate risks to juvenile salmon, particularly Sockeye Salmon, associated with sea lice infections. The results may be useful in establishing criteria for netpen salmon aquaculture related to siting and site-related thresholds such as production limits and stocking densities.

PATHOGEN SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOCKEYE SALMON – PHASE 1: INFECTIOUS SALMON ANEMIA (ISAV) AND ALPHAVIRUS (SPDV),,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited,"Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) is the third most common Pacific salmon species, after Pink and Chum Salmon. The Fraser River salmon run has experienced declines in productivity since the 1990s. The reasons for this decline remain speculative. The Commission of Inquiry into the Decline of Sockeye Salmon in the Fraser River was launched as a consequence. One recommendation of the report is that “The DFO should undertake or commission research into the health of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, including: the hypothesis that diseases are transmitted from farmed salmon to wild Sockeye”. The CFIA-led, BC surveillance was launched in 2012. Thousands of samples were tested for ISAV and none was found. Although the testing meets the statistical requirements to eventually declare disease freedom, it does not look at the susceptibility of Pacific salmon species to the pathogens targeted. The risk of introduction is minimal but the consequences of an introduction or of an outbreak in a farm are not predictable without this data. We propose to examine disease resistance or susceptibility of Sockeye to various pathogens known to affect Atlantic Salmon, e.g., ISAV and SPDV (or Salmon Alphavirus). With the expertise in DFO, along with high level biocontainment facilities, this type of disease research can proceed and will generate essential knowledge for better management practices. `",APR. 2014,MAR. 2018,DFO – Aquaculture Collaborative Research and Development Program (DFO – ACRDP),"Nellie Gagne (DFO); Francis Leblanc, Phil Byrne (DFO); Diane Morrison (Marine Havest Canada)",Aquaculture - Fish Health
"ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL FOR WATERBORNE TRANSMISSION OF INFECTIOUS HEMATOPOIETIC NECROSIS VIRUS (IHNV) BETWEEN SALMON FARMS AND WILD SOCKEYE IN THE DISCOVERY ISLANDS, BRITISH COLUMBIA",,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.),"Results from this study will provide further tools to manage infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, and allow DFO to ensure the protection of farmed and wild fish health by determining optimal locations for aquaculture sites. In British Columbia, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus is responsible for major economic losses in Atlantic Salmon aquaculture operations. Due to the significance of this pathogen, it is important to understand the risk of, and factors affecting, viral dispersion from infected sites. To this end, this study is developing a viral dispersion model for the Discovery Islands, an area home to multiple net-pen salmon farms. Accurate geo-spatial predictions of risk for IHNV transmission are simulated through the coupling of IHNV transmission parameter estimates as reported (PLoS ONE 8(12):e82296) with a recently developed hydrodynamic ocean circulation model for the Discovery Islands (Atmosphere- Ocean 50(3):301-306). Additionally risk estimates are not only quantified for disease transmission potential between farms, but also between farmed Atlantic and wild Sockeye Salmon. Utilizing empirical data obtained through controlled laboratory exposure studies, the susceptibility of saltwater phase Sockeye Salmon to IHN disease is determined. Ultimately, temporally- and spatially-evolving viral concentration maps are combined with the lab-determined minimum infectious dosages to estimate the infection connectivity among farms and risk of virus spread to wild fish.

INVESTIGATING PROBIOTIC BACTERIA AND THEIR BACTERIOCINS AS PART OF A DISEASE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IN SALMON AQUA CULTURE,,University of Alberta (U Alberta); Marine Harvest Canada Inc.; Cermaq Canada Ltd.; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO),"This research will offer the first comprehensive assessment of the antibiotic properties of known and unknown bacteriocins and, as such, constitutes an investigation into a novel category of drug treatment. The results of this research will help inform disease management strategies to minimize the impact of pathogens and ultimately improve fish health. The susceptibility of farmed salmon to bacterial disease and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus species) is a health management issue for the aquaculture industry. Currently, antibiotics and antiparasitics are used to treat bacteria and sea lice, respectively, however, there are concerns regarding the effectiveness and long term sustainability of these methods. This research project will evaluate the potential for probiotic bacteria (microorganisms associated with beneficial effects to humans and animals) and bacteriocins (antimicrobial, naturally occurring compounds produced by certain bacteria) to aid in the reduction of antibiotics currently used to treat bacterial diseases in salmon. Another point of focus will be on the potential of Bacillus and Paenibacillus bacterial species to aid in reducing the use of chemical therapeutants, such as emamectin benzoate (SLICER), as a treatment of sea lice infections in salmon.

DOES CHALLENGE WITH THE BRITISH COLUMBIA STRAIN OF PISCINE REOVIRUS AFFECT ATLANTIC OR SOCKEYE SALMON?,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited,"This study suggests PRV from the Pacific Coast of British Columbia is of low pathogenicity in Atlantic and Sockeye Salmon. Piscine reovirus (PRV ) was first discovered in Norwegian farmed Atlantic Salmon with the disease heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). While fish with HSMI generally carry higher loads of PRV , clinically healthy fish in Norway also carry the virus. PRV is geographically widespread, occurring in the Atlantic, as well as in wild and farmed salmon in the Pacific Ocean where HSMI has not been reported. Consequently, the presence of PRV in asymptomatic fish raises questions concerning the exact relationship between PRV and HSMI. To evaluate the risk posed to native and cultured salmon residing in the Pacific, we utilized controlled laboratory exposures to determine virulence of PRV in Atlantic and Sockeye Salmon. Naive Atlantic Salmon challenged by intraperitoneal injection of PRV positive tissue homogenate resulted in development of a sustained PRV infection; however, compared to control groups there were no significant differences in morbidity due to PRV exposure and no evidence of HSMI. We also demonstrated that PRV could spread to naive Atlantic and Sockeye Salmon by waterborne transmission with nearly 100% of naive fish becoming positive after 4 weeks of exposure. Despite the development of persistent infections, no fish to date have showed any morbidity, gross signs of disease, or histological evidence of HSMI when compared to controls.

FIELD VALIDATION OF DIETARY MEDICATION TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF KUDOA THYRSITES IN FARMED ATLANTIC SALMON ,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited,"Farmed Atlantic Salmon are at risk of infection with Kudoa thyrsites throughout British Columbia (BC), leading to an elevated risk of reduced fillet quality. The cost to the BC farmed Atlantic Salmon industry was over $15 million in 2010, adding to the difficulty for the BC industry to remain competitive in the global salmon market. Early screening of farmed stock is now often used for Kudoa detection. Neither vaccines nor medicines are currently available for the prevention or treatment of the infection. This project evaluated the efficacy of dietary nicarbazin against Kudoa in Atlantic Salmon held in a production environment. The results of this study confirmed that under production conditions, treatment of seawater-reared Atlantic Salmon with a medicated diet containing nicarbazin results in elevated muscle residues of dinitrocarbanilide (DNC). The study also confirmed observations made in laboratory studies that DNC declines rapidly in muscle following cessation of medication. An alternative treatment regime will be required to ensure that DNC residues are sufficiently high over a longer duration during the grow-out phase of salmon production to maximize efficacy against Kudoa in harvest fish.

IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF GYRODA CTYLID INFECTIONS IN CULTURED WOLF-EELS (ANARRHICHTHYS OCELLATUS),,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Vancouver Aquarium ,"Wolf-eels (Anarrhichthys ocellatus) are considered an appropriate new species for development in the Canadian aquaculture industry and recent research has looked at the potential to move this culture species from experimental to commercial production. During their studies, researchers identified a commonly occurring parasite (Gyrodactylus spp.) that was responsible for recurring disease outbreaks in captive-reared wolf-eels which could ultimately impede production. The objective of this project was to investigate Gyrodactylus outbreaks occurring in captive reared wolf-eels, identify the species responsible, and develop an efficacious treatment protocol. The parasite infecting wolf-eels at the CAER facility in West Vancouver was confirmed as Gyrodactylus corti, originally described from captive wolf-eels in California. This research suggested that G. corti is a common parasite of wolf-eels and that increased intensities of infection occur in captivity. Infections cause an acute reaction in the gills, which contributes to elevated mortality. Infection with G. corti caused mortality as high as 83% among captive wolf-eels. This research demonstrated that the most effective treatment against G. corti was formalin baths and, to a lesser extent, freshwater baths. However, both treatments only provide temporary or partial benefits as infections have been observed to recur. Careful management of newly captured wolf-eels, including quarantine and treatment is recommended. This research was needed to assess risk, develop treatment protocols, and to provide new information that will be essential for a successful wolf-eel aquaculture industry. Further research will need to explore additional regimes of formalin, freshwater, or combined treatments, in order to optimize results.",APR. 2012,MAR. 2013 ,DFO – Aquaculture Collaborative Research and Development Program (DFO – ACRDP); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Vancouver Aquarium ,Simon Jones (DFO); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Vancouver Aquarium ,Aquaculture - Fish Health
THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR EXPOSURE AND BODY SIZE ON THE INTENSITY OF KUDOA THYRSITES INFECTIONS IN ATLANTIC SALMON,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited; Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.) ,"The knowledge gained through this research project will lead to a greater understanding of disease transmission and wild-farmed interactions. Additionally, this information will allow for better finfish cage siting and decision making and the development of tools to help further manage this disease. The parasite, Kudoa thyrsites, is the cause of soft-flesh syndrome in post-harvest Atlantic Salmon farmed in British Columbia. Infected fish exhibit no clinical signs of disease, but the affected muscle rapidly deteriorates after processing. These infections can cause substantial economic hardship to the salmon aquaculture industry with some sites estimating a 10% loss of annual yield, resulting in losses of between $6–10 million. Currently, there are no vaccines or approved strategies for treatment (e.g., chemotherapeutic intervention) for K. thyrsites. Earlier research revealed geographic variation in the prevalence and intensity of K. thyrsites in Atlantic Salmon reared at different seawater production sites. This research discovered that infections typically resolve between six and twelve months following laboratory exposure of fish to the parasite, and therefore, the occurrence of infections in harvested salmon after 18 months or more in seawater suggest multiple or ongoing exposures to the parasite during commercial net pen rearing. This project will further investigate options for managing K. thyrsites infections. Firstly, it will test the efficacy of ultraviolet irradiation of seawater as a method to inactivate K. thrysites in the laboratory and further study the influence of prior exposure to K. thyrsites on parasite development during subsequent exposure. The project will also assess the influence of fish size on the prevalence and severity of the infection.

REFINEMENT OF AN INFECTIOUS HEMATOPOIETIC NECROSIS VIRUS DISPERSION MODEL FOR THE DISCOVERY ISLANDS AREA AND AN EXTENSION TO WEST COAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Marine Harvest Canada Limited; Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.,"In British Columbia, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is the most economically important viral pathogen of salmonids. To begin to assess the risk of viral dispersal through waterborne transmission from an infected site, it is necessary to understand, not only the biological parameters associated with virus dispersion, but also the physical components of the environment in which the virus is being dispersed. This project aimed to refine the physical and biological measurements of the established viral dispersion model. Specifically, the risk of virus transmission from APEX vaccinated Atlantic Salmon was determined, as well as investigated the susceptibility of Sockeye Salmon to IHNV. The vaccinated Atlantic Salmon were highly protected against the development of the lethal IHN disease such that out of 100 APEX vaccinated Atlantic Salmon only two fish succumbed to IHN disease. This protection was afforded regardless of whether the vaccinated fish were exposed to IHNV via intraperitoneal injection or waterborne immersion. In preliminary trials on Sockeye susceptibility to IHNV, no mortality was observed in either the mock challenge group or the two lowest virus exposure levels. Mortality was only observed at the two highest IHN virus exposure levels tested with cumulative mortality ranging from 8% to 36%. Quantification of the IHNV transmission parameters obtained through this project will enable accurate geospatial predictions of risk for IHNV transmission from marine salmon sites. Understanding how the virus is dispersed among salmon farms will ultimately increase the sustainability of the aquaculture industry through optimization of fish health.",APR. 2011,MAR. 2013,DFO – Aquaculture Collaborative Research and Development Program (DFO – ACRDP); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.); Marine Harvest Canada Limited ,Kyle Garver (DFO); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Mainstream Canada (Cermaq Canada Ltd.); Marine Harvest Canada Limited,Aquaculture - Fish Health

Environmental monitoring of marine finfish aquaculture operations in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and British Columbia rely on the measurement of sulfide concentrations in sediment (within farm leases) as the fundamental indicator of adverse environmental impacts from finfish farming at soft bottom sites. Government departments in NB, NS, and BC have established their own Standard Operating Procedures (SO Ps) to evaluate the aquaculture industry’s environmental impact. Comparisons among the SO Ps indicate several differences among regions, which could lead to differing results. Previous research has revealed that the standard solutions (“standards”) used in sediment sulfide monitoring degrade significantly over time and that probe accuracy also degrades over time (post-calibration). These results suggest the need for additional research on sediment sulfide methodologies including possible changes in probe accuracy following their use in sediments with high sulfide concentrations and the effects of salinity on these standards.

Various environmental and hydrographic data relevant to Baynes Sound, BC, were compiled and relationships between these factors and PSP events were evaluated using statistical analyses (correlations). The most important factors in predicting PSP levels were time of the year, salinity, and rainfall pattern. Specifically, the amount of measurable rain that fell three and four days prior to sampling was found to correlate with PSP levels.

The Network consists of 27 scientists from 8 universities (UBC, UNBSJ , VIU, UVic, UPEI, U Guelph, Dalhousie U, and SFU), 6 federal government laboratories (DFO), 1 provincial government laboratory (New Brunswick Research and Productivity Council), and 4 industrial partners (Cooke Aquaculture Inc., Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd., Marine Harvest Canada Ltd., and Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.). The Network is hosted by the University of New Brunswick in Saint John (UNBSJ ). Training of Highly Qualified Persons (HQPs) is a very high priority for CIMTAN . The initial target of training 114 HQPs, over the entire life of the Network, has been exceeded in 2014, as 116 have already been trained: 60 undergraduate/summer students; 22 MSc, 4 MASc, 5 MRM and 3 MA graduate students; 4 PhD students; 6 postdoctoral fellows; 11 technicians; and 1 research scientist. There has been significant mobility of HQPs and investigators within projects, between east and west coast projects and internationally (Norway and Chile), as it is important to develop a versatile and inter-disciplinary workforce if we want the scientists, policy influencers, decision makers, regulators, and industrialists of tomorrow to be innovative and build a more diversified and responsible aquaculture sector. One of the incremental benefits of a network approach includes access to an enlarged equipment and tool inventory at academic institutions and government laboratories. Conducting experimental research on the east and west coasts in a concerted manner allows the acquisition of complementary and compatible information, hence increasing research outputs and outcomes and reducing redundancies in research efforts. Moreover, by gathering data on a wide geographical and temporal basis, with a wide range of environmental conditions, more generalized trends may be discerned. This will allow for the design of more robust systems and policies, taking into consideration both the universality of some aspects and the regional specificity of others. After 4 years of existence, CIMTAN has produced a diversified array of documents and media directed at different audiences: 40 refereed journal articles, 17 refereed conference publications, 8 book chapters, edited 1 Bulletin of the Aquaculture Association of Canada, 17 non-refereed publications, 198 abstracts, 2 technical reports, 1 Wikipedia article, 7 YouTube videos, 20 CIMTAN Snippets newsletters, and numerous media contacts (magazine articles, newspapers/radio/TV interviews and documentaries).

CULTIVATION OF COMPLEMENTARY INORGANI C EXTRACTIVE SPECIES FOR INCREASED SYSTEM PERFORMANCE,,University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"This project investigates the red alga Palmaria palmata (dulse) for increased inorganic bio-mitigation of IMTA systems when kelps are not present at the sites. Little is known about the complex life history or the presence of the different phases of this species in nature, especially during fall and winter. Recruitment was monitored on the shore with twines mounted on frames. The number and size of recruits increase during summer and the occurrence of the different generations was documented. By varying desiccation time, darkness period, and seawater temperature, massive releases of tetraspores are now obtained. Desiccation and temperature play an important role in the induction of tetraspore release. A technique for rapid and reliable quantification and sizing of these large and fragile spores was developed using a Coulter Counter. We then worked on the best substrates for successful spore settlement. The effect of light on germination and growth of tetraspores into male and female gametophytes is now being studied. Molecular techniques are being developed to distinguish male gametophytes from tetrasporophytes, which are indistinguishable when reproductively immature. Organic certification was also obtained for the two kelps, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta, already cultivated at the IMTA sites. This research will develop another inorganic extractive species for the summer period, whereas kelps are at the sites from the fall to spring/early summer. The project is also looking at the development of appropriate and efficient regulations for seaweeds and for the management of inorganic nutrient biomitigation at the Bay Management Area (BMA) level.

SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF IMTA: EXPLORING THE FUTURE OF COASTAL AQUACULTURE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR IMTA ADOPTION IN BRITISH COLUMBIA,,University of Victoria (UVic); Vancouver Island University (VIU),"This study is identifying some of the key concerns that First Nations communities have regarding the development of aquaculture within their traditional territories. It is also assessing the level of awareness of IMTA and the information needs that must be met before First Nations can consider the adoption of IMTA. This project focuses on the social implications (governance, community development, First Nations) aspects of IMTA. Our focus to date has been on gaining insight into First Nations perspectives on coastal aquaculture practices and their assessment of IMTA as a sustainable production system that is consistent with traditional values. This research is being undertaken on the west coast, as most aquaculture tenures in BC are located within First Nation traditional territories. Any changes in existing tenures, or development of new ones, require consultation with First Nations communities. To provide a basis for broader consultations regarding the opportunities and challenges facing the adoption of IMTA within First Nations traditional territories, a key informant survey was undertaken to assess concerns with seaweed, shellfish, and finfish farming. Generally, farming seaweeds was not something that had been considered by the communities. Shellfish aquaculture, however, was seen as a promising economic development opportunity that was consistent with their traditional values. There was very strong opposition to salmon farming owing to the perceived environmental and ecosystem impacts. While there was interest in IMTA, the informants also acknowledged a lack of information on the ecological and economic aspects of its development.

"A VARIATION ON THE IMTA THEME FOR LAND-BASED, FRESHWATER AQUACULTURE OPERATIONS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRESHWATER IMTA (FIMTA) FOR SALMON AND AQUAPONIC PLANTS",,University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"The Freshwater IMTA program (FIMTA) helps identify effluent treatment efficiency strategies for different hatchery configurations to meet regulatory limits. The pilot-scale FIMTA system is very useful for selecting plants that will be a good match for conditions experienced at fish hatcheries in a cold temperate climate. Developing FIMTA will allow an extension of IMTA from egg to plate, increase water reuse, and product diversification. Analyses were performed to identify the best setting for a pilot FIMTA project at different freshwater salmon hatchery facilities. A computerized visual assessment tool was developed to evaluate hatchery performances regarding dissolved nutrient recovery. The treatment system efficacy (physical, chemical, and biological) was analysed at different locations within hatcheries. A visual interface provides a fast and reliable way to simplify application development and accelerate management. Data are then subjected to regulatory levels. The program contains a series of databases accessible to the various software objects, including both static and dynamic data. Databases are maintained for each component for basic information, simulation settings, and water characteristics. The program consists of a communication interface and other basic forms such as necessary flow, nutrient concentrations, and efficiency potential percentages. The management tool interface can identify and predict dissolved nutrient concentrations and flows at the different locations. A variety of edible, ornamental, and medicinal plants are tested for growth and nutrient absorption capabilities in a temperature/ light controlled FIMTA pilot-scale system using effluent water from a local commercial hatchery. The use of IMTA kelp biochar, as a medium for seedling development and plant support, is also examined.",SEP. 2012,DEC. 2015,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Strategic Network Program; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick (UNB); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd. ,"Thierry Chopin (UNBSJ); Hamid Khoda Bakhsh, Stacy Murray, Ellen Belyea, Adrian Hamer (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.",Aquaculture - CIMTAN
DEVELOPING TOOLS TO QUANTIFY SALMON AQUACULTURE NUTRIENTS IN WILD AND CULTURED ALTERNATIVE SPECIES,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"New methods to quantify and monitor impacts of aquaculture nutrient enrichment on the environment are being investigated. To better understand the influence of particulate nutrient sources in the midwater zone, the relationship between fouling species, distance, and the physical environment were tested using an array of bio-colonization plates. The most prevalent fouling species near salmon aquaculture sites are studied for changes in bio-accumulation rates and instantaneous growth. Bio-accumulation for these species is surprisingly variable around a salmon farm and can provide information on optimal IMTA site design with respect to nutrient availability and environmental conditions. The colour response in three native macro-algae (Ulva lactuca, Pyropia purpurea, and Palmaria palmata), relative to their total nitrogen content, has also been investigated. The objective is to develop a simple technique, based on colour characterization (lightness, chroma, and hue), as a faster and cheaper proxy for biochemical analyses of tissue total nitrogen content. If this approach can lead to the development of a useful tool, monitors will be able to quickly and cheaply determine the internal nitrogen content of the selected algal species and the conditions to which it was likely to have been exposed, using this macro-alga as an indicator-over-time of nutrient loading. Such methods can offer new tools for measuring changes in nutrient exposure for both wild and cultured species in the coastal zone, and a new approach to monitoring nutrient effects of aquaculture with respect to optimal design for integrated species and overall site performance.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PARTICULATE DYNAMICS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON UPTAKE SPECIES PLACEMENT AT AN IMTA SITE,,University of Victoria (UVic); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"This research shows the value of using high resolution bio-optical data within an IMTA setting. The results are consistent with others showing particulate waste dilution during high ambient seston periods and the dominant vertical dispersion of particulate wastes towards the seafloor. Bio-optical parameters are commonly used to collect high resolution particulate concentration/composition data within the coastal environment. However, these methods are rarely utilized within aquaculture settings. This study focused on the collection of bio-optical data within a sablefish cage at an IMTA site on the west coast of Vancouver Island. This was done to gain an understanding of ambient particulate dynamics and also to detail the dispersion of organic wastes to aid in the placement of secondary uptake species for waste assimilation. During autumn/winter, ambient seston concentrations were low and distinct bio-optical enhancements were measured with time after feeding at the bottom of the studied cage, likely due to fish wastes. In contrast, spring/summer bio-optical variability was driven by phytoplankton and wastes were likely diluted into the particle rich environments. These results suggest that particulate wastes would be most available to uptake species during low seston conditions. Additionally, due to the observed dominant vertical movement of wastes, the most effective placement of uptake species for waste assimilation is likely below the studied cage. With further research, bio-optical measurements could provide valuable high resolution data on both ambient and waste particulate dynamics within aquaculture settings.

DESIGN AND INVESTIGATION OF FEASIBILITY OF DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT CONTROL OF A RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM AT AN IMTA SITE,,University of Victoria (UVic); Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.,"Aquaculture sites are often remotely located, far from grid electricity. As the overall intent of IMTA is to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture operations, the provision of clean power on-site is being investigated to avoid the need for diesel gensets which are used currently. The primary electrical loads are a set of winches on a moveable tram used for raising and lowering extractive species nets. A battery-solar system has been initially designed for the west coast demonstration site using a custom probabilistic energy system sizing program. Detailed physical design of the system has evolved to a configuration that places the solar panels and battery modules in a hut at one end of the fish farm docks, and includes a diesel backup to ensure continuous operations in the event of system interruption. The system consists of eight 175 W solar panels, a 1500 Ah battery bank, and an existing 2 kW backup gasoline generator. Cables then provide power to the mobile tram with electric winches, as well as various power ports on the docks for incidental loads. Sensors are included to measure system performance and insolation (exposure to the sun) for testing purposes. Once the system is fully installed and operational, data will be gathered to assess the accuracy of the prediction/sizing models, thereby validating the model for use in the design of renewable energy systems for other IMTA sites. The demonstration project will prove out the feasibility of a renewably powered IMTA system on the west coast. The sizing/performance modelling tool will be validated and available for future design of other IMTA renewable systems.

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF IMTA,,Simon Fraser University (SFU),"In the last year, we completed a first ever assessment of how British Columbians value their coastal environment as a pretext to examining the role that IMTA might play in supporting these values. Since we carried out similar analyses in the markets for BC farmed salmon earlier (in the USA), we anticipate an interesting comparative analysis to emerge from this work. Similarly, we framed our research in both locations to be a comparison of IMTA and closed containment versus conventional monoculture, so that we could assess preferences for these two alternative technologies in relation to the monoculture reference. Our initial results suggest that US consumers view IMTA much more favorably than closed containment, while BC residents are the opposite. Thus, we detect large differences in preferences between the producing (BC) and consuming (USA west coast) regions towards alternative technologies. This year also saw our newly initiated research emphasis shift from the market context for IMTA to modelling the production economics side of IMTA , including qualitative analyses of the industry’s reasons for adoption or non-adoption, identifying the full costs of shifting to IMTA , and simulating the full economic and environmental costs of IMTA versus monoculture. Results are not yet available for these activities. We anticipate our main impact will be on how policymakers, researchers, and the general public perceive the appropriate response to problems associated with monoculture salmon farming. Our expectation is that this will influence the design of incentives to help the industry better align its activities with society’s best interests and to allow IMTA to play an appropriate role in the process.

EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED AND EXISTING IMTA SITES USING AN ECOSYSTEM MODELING APPROACH,,Dalhousie University; University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"This modelling scheme provides valuable information for the aquaculture industry in order to improve the siting of existing and new IMTA sites. The outcomes of the model could be used to define areas of potential impact, investigate interactions with other marine resources, and design monitoring guidelines. The design of ocean-based finfish-shellfish IMTA farms is not trivial due to the complexity of coastal areas, particularly because biological processes in open waters are influenced by water circulation, which includes the dispersal of finfish wastes. Consequently, the design of new IMTA sites or the evaluation of existing sites require a combined study of biological and physical processes, which can be achieved by the execution and coupling of mathematical models. In this project, a highly configurable mathematical model that can be applied at the apparent spatial scale of IMTA sites has been developed. The model allows for tracking of the different components of the seston in an IMTA site, including feed wastes, fish faeces, shellfish faeces, natural detritus, and phytoplankton. Based on the characterization of these fluxes of matter, the model can be used to explore different spatial arrangements for evaluating and improving finfish/ shellfish farm efficiency. The model also predicts that the mitigation efficiency of the IMTA farm is highly dependent on the background environmental conditions.",SEP. 2012,DEC. 2015,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Strategic Network Program; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick (UNB); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd. ,"Jonathan Grant (Dalhousie U); Ramon Filgueira, Thomas Guyondet, Peter Cranford (DFO); Gregor Reid (UNBSJ, DFO); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.",Aquaculture - CIMTAN
"CAN FILTER-FEEDING BIVALVES INGEST PLANKTONIC SEA LICE, LEADING TO REDUCED SEA LICE NUMBERS ON CULTIVATED SALMON?",,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of Victoria (UVic); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.,"The development of non-chemical sea lice mitigation techniques such as IMTA filter-feeding bivalves may help improve the environmental, societal, and economic performance of salmon farms. The close proximity of salmon farms and wild Pacific salmon stocks in British Columbia is an important incentive for precautionary sea lice management strategies. We are investigating whether IMTA filter-feeding bivalves can provide preventative, natural sea louse control by ingesting sea lice larvae (nauplii and copepodids) from the water column, a system that exploits the sea louse life cycle and the natural filtration capabilities of bivalves. Field trials were conducted at a commercial salmon farm in British Columbia using Pacific Oysters, one of several bivalve species that consumed sea lice larvae in previous laboratory experiments. 30,000 oysters were deployed in trays at three depths around one end of the farm’s 2 x 7 square-cage array, and at a nearby control site. Throughout the study, oysters at the farm generally grew larger (both in shell length and tissue biomass) than oysters at the control site. Larval and attached sea lice stages were counted monthly in bivalve and control (no bivalves) fish cages. Sea lice larval densities and numbers of sea lice on the fish followed a similar monthly trend, peaking in January/February. Oyster digestive tracts were preserved and will be analyzed for partially-digested sea lice and sea louse DNA presence.",JAN. 2010,DEC. 2015,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Strategic Network Program; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick (UNB); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd. ,"Chris Pearce (DFO); Stephen Cross, Allison Byrne, Janis Webb (UVic); Simon Jones, Shawn Robinson (DFO); Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.",Aquaculture - CIMTAN
EFFECTS OF ANTI-SEA LICE PESTICIDES ON MARINE INVERTEBRATES,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ),"Pesticides used to control ectoparasitic sea lice in salmon aquaculture are released in effluent plumes or treated feed and faeces from cage sites and have the potential to adversely affect non-target organisms. The toxicity of common anti-sea lice treatments AlphaMaxR (active ingredient (a.i.) deltamethrin), ExcisR (a.i. cypermethrin), InteroxRParamove™ 50 (a.i. hydrogen peroxide), SalmosanR (a.i. azamethiphos), and emamectin benzoate (an avermectin) have not been adequately studied for benthic crustaceans, such as marine amphipods, clam worms (sediment dwellers), and zooplankton living in the water column. The main objectives were to examine whether several species of invertebrates, native to the Bay of Fundy, are affected by common anti-sea lice treatments. Growth, behaviour, and survival of clam worms, zooplankton, and amphipods were assessed after shorter-term (up to 96 hours) and longer-term (10 to 30 days) exposures. Emamectin benzoate and AlphaMaxR decreased the growth and burrowing behaviour of clam worms at sediment concentrations that may be found near cage sites. Similarly, environmentally realistic exposures of zooplankton to several of the pesticides reduced feeding and survival. Amphipod survival also decreased at AlphaMaxR and ExcisR concentrations that may be found in an effluent plume from a cage site. These results suggest that the use of some anti-sea lice pesticides may pose a risk to non-target marine invertebrates living in the sediments and water column near cage sites.

QUANTIFYING THE CAPTURE AND CONVERSION EFFICIENCIES OF SPECIES BEING CONSIDERED FOR ORGANIC EXTRACTION IN OPEN-WATER IMTA SYSTEMS,,University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of Victoria (UVic); University of British Columbia (UBC); Vancouver Island University (VIU); Vancouver Aquarium,"This project is assessing the capability of different invertebrate species to capture, absorb and convert particulate fish-farm waste into new production. On the east coast, Blue Mussels (Mytilus edulis) have been shown to be capable of ingesting and efficiently absorbing small organic material from both fish food, and faeces. After a variety of feeding trials using small artificial diets in the laboratory and natural particles at IMTA sites, we determined that the Orange-footed Sea Cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) could also efficiently extract larger organic material from farm waste. Ongoing studies include assessing the feeding rate and particle size that sea cucumbers are utilizing as well as their faecal deposition rates. On the west coast, species being assessed for extractive capabilities include filter feeders, such as Basket Cockles (Clinocardium nuttallii) and M. edulis, as well as deposit feeders such as Green Sea Urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), California Sea Cucumbers (Parastichopus californicus) and Pacific Prawns (Pandalus platyceros). Sea urchins and sea cucumbers were found to ingest and absorb Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) faeces at rates comparable to or higher than those for traditional diets such as kelps and natural sediment, respectively.

Initial project work utilized the Finite-Volume primitive equation Community Ocean Model (FVCOM ) to model localized currents around an IMTA site in Kyuquot Sound, Vancouver Island. Recent project developments have involved the deployment of 1 to 15 scale model cage-arrays in the Flume Tank facility at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Wake velocity studies have been completed on east coast circular aquaculture cage-arrays at common cage spacing used in the industry. Measurements at different distances downstream of the model arrays show wake topology, velocity deficits, and wake recovery. Unsteadiness and large scale turbulence has been observed in the wake of cage-arrays. Dye release studies have been completed in order to observe the flow field in and around cages within the array. Results to date indicate large velocity deficits in cages wakes, forcing flow around and below cages. The dye release data agree well with wake velocity measurements.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR OPEN-WATER IMTA –DEVELOPING TOOLS TO SUPPORT SYSTEM DESIGN AND MEASURES OF SUSTAINABILITY,,University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of Guelph (U Guelph); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"This project aims to quantify open-water IMTA efficiency of nutrient recovery and augmented growth. Several publications have been produced to date. One study explored the seaweed biomass required to remove soluble nutrients from salmon culture. The mean weight ratios of the seaweeds Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima required to sequester all soluble nutrients excreted per unit weight of salmon range from 4:1 to 13:1, depending on the nutrient. Another study reported the proportion of fish farm solids ingested by mussels needed to reduce site-wide organic loading at an IMTA site, which ranged between 10% and 20%. A third modelling study suggested the bio-mitigation potential of mussels will be greatest where seston abundance is low, organic dietary content high, and that achieving maximal waste extraction by mussel co-culture entails food particule depletion that may limit mussel production. Organic mitigation efficiency of deposit feeders are presently being modelled. Project results are providing valuable inputs for an IMTA bio-economic model being developed. This project has recently fostered some unique collaborations with IMTA projects in Norway.

QUANTIFYING THE ROLE OF MICROBES IN THE NUTRIENT RECYCLING OF ORGANIC MATERIAL FROM IMTA SITES,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.,"Understanding how nutrients are recycled around aquaculture sites in both time and space will allow better designing of future fish farms and how to fallow them between crops. Marine bacteria are ubiquitous in both pelagic and benthic environments where they play a significant role in biomass, biodiversity, and biogeochemical processes such as recycling of organic nutrients. Most are nonpathogenic, generally operate unseen due to their small size, but are thought to be important in the nutrient dynamics around aquaculture farms. The objectives of this project are to determine bacterial species composition and abundance and their ecological role in nutrient recycling at IMTA sites. The research is showing that there are significant differences in the patterns of nutrient dynamics occurring in the water column compared to the sea bottom. Gradients of dissolved and particulate nutrients are very difficult to detect in the water column although higher levels of bacteria can be found near the farm, suggesting that these bacteria are capable of quickly assimilating the released nutrients. On the sea bottom near the farm where most of the particulate matter settles, there is a decreasing gradient of bacteria away from the site. Based on molecular analytical techniques, the study is finding that the bacterial species closest to the site are often specialists in nutrient recycling. This information is being incorporated into a computer model on nutrient dynamics at IMTA sites.

OPTIMIZING IMTA SPECIES COMPONENT STOCKING DENSITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE ORIENTATION TO MAXIMIZE OVERALL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick - St. John (UNBSJ); University of Victoria (UVic); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.,"Expanding our knowledge of nutrient transfer within current IMTA site designs will help the industry develop their infrastructure. Developing the aquaculture of the California Sea Cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), as a benthic extractive species within IMTA systems, and addressing issues such as its containment, will be mutually beneficial to resource managers and industry partners. To improve the sustainability of IMTA systems, extractive species’ stocking densities and infrastructure orientations need to be optimised such that they maximise the interception of fish-farm nutrients and IMTA efficiency. In order to achieve this objective, the dynamics of nutrient transfer within the site needs to be understood to choose the best configuration and species mix. On the east coast, empirical studies on flow patterns, organic particle densities, and their utilization by farmed and wild species are studied on conventional salmon and IMTA sites to provide input on a model for site efficiency. On the west coast, the project is focused on optimizing the benthic extraction of nutrients within an IMTA system using the detritus-feeding California Sea Cucumber, P. californicus. The California Sea Cucumber has been established as a promising candidate for IMTA due to its ability to extract benthic nutrients and its high market value. The potential for suspended trays within an IMTA system, as juvenile rearing habitat for P. californicus, are further examined.

A greater understanding of disease dynamics between trophic levels is a key part of health management within integrated settings. Our goal has been to modify an infection model for the microsporidian pathogen Loma salmonae, and use this model to evaluate the role that Blue Mussels may have to act as environmentally released spores within an IMTA setting. Specifically, asking the question of whether Blue Mussels may serve to mitigate disease transmission by deactivating spores that they encounter during feeding. The model has been successfully developed and now allows us to modify various environmental and temporal parameters. A very useful, and unexpected outcome, was the establishment of L. salmonae within cell culture. This advance will allow far greater flexibility in our studies, both as a tool for producing spores, but also for detecting them within environmental niches under study. To date, we have determined that Blue Mussels are very effective in extracting microsporidial spores from the environmnent; spores are subsequently released in pseudofeces, or feces, and small proportion of them stored for several weeks within mussel viscera. Spores are not rendered defective whether they are retained, or passed within egesta; in vitro tests of spore viability have been evaluated against the gold standard in vivo measures of infectivity.",JAN. 2010,DEC. 2015,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Strategic Network Program; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick (UNB); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd. ,"Dave Speare (UPEI-AVC); Sarah McConnachie, Nicole Guselle (UPEI-AVC)",Aquaculture - CIMTAN
"SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF IMTA: SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE IN BAYNES SOUND, BRITISH COLUMBIA",,Vancouver Island University (VIU),"When asked to weigh the costs and benefits of the industry, most participants expressed uncertainty. This uncertainty may indicate ongoing struggles to balance what many feel are largely economic benefits against experiential and environmental concerns. It may also signal that participants have not yet fully formed a solidly positive or negative opinion of the industry, offering an opportunity to the shellfish industry. As a relatively new industry, it is unclear how aquaculture affects the well-being of the social-ecological systems in which it is embedded. Baynes Sound farms produce half of all shellfish cultured in British Columbia, over 3,700 tonnes per year, and are surrounded by more than 6,500 residents on Vancouver Island and Denman Island. To ensure the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of Baynes Sound, and other social-ecological systems, the aquaculture industry must be better understood. The concept of well-being helps us move beyond simple “jobs versus the environment” understandings of effects, and provides a more holistic way to understand the preferences the residences of Baynes Sound have for social-ecological conditions and the ways in which these conditions may be enhanced or diminished by shellfish aquaculture activities. The purpose of this research study was to identify and measure the perceived effects of shellfish aquaculture on the Baynes Sound social-ecological system. Over a three year period, we used qualitative interviews, surveys, focus groups, and a photo-voice component to answer the question: what are the mechanisms by which the activities of the shellfish aquaculture industry promote and/or erode community well-being in the Baynes Sound social-ecological system as assessed by local residents?",JAN. 2010,DEC. 2015,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Strategic Network Program; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); University of New Brunswick (UNB); New Brunswick Research Productivity Council (NBRPC); Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd. ,Grant Murray (VIU); Linda D’Anna (VIU),Aquaculture - CIMTAN
IMPROVING OYSTER (CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA) SEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION IN NOVA SCOTIA,,University of British Columbia (UBC); Dalhousie University (Dalhousie U); Gulf Aquaculture Association (GAA),"The demand for oyster in the USA and European markets is increasing, but the traditional sources of supply have been faced with increasing stresses due to both anthropological causes (e.g., oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico) and extreme environmental changes. The international markets are seeking supply from Canadian waters, but the production of oysters in Atlantic Canada, particularly from Nova Scotia, could not cope with the increasing demand. Recognizing this great market opportunity, the shellfish producers in Nova Scotia approached NS Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and the Aquaculture Centre at Dalhousie University to assist the industry to improve oyster production in the province. With financial assistance from NSDFA and Gulf Aquaculture Association (GAA), Jesse Ronquillo and his research team developed innovative hatchery procedures for improved method in oyster seedstock production using various spawning induction techniques and continuous production of selected microalgal species rich in omega-3 fatty acids for faster growth and increased survival rate of seedstock. More than 500 million pediveligers or eyed-larvae were produced for remote setting and grow-out operations of shellfish growers in Northumberland Strait. The inexpensive and innovative hatchery production techniques developed through the collaborative project can be adopted by shellfish growers to produce oyster seedstock without extensive investment on costly infrastructure and equipment.

YEAR-ROUND SPAWNING AND LARVAL REARING OF GEODUCK (PANOPEA GENEROSA) IN CLOSED CULTURE SYSTEM,,"University of British Columbia (UBC); BC Pacific Oyster Ltd. (BCPOL)
","This simple and inexpensive closed-culture system for geoduck spawning can be replicated as needed. The portability of the University of British Columbia’s (UBC) design of a seawater filtration system can be adopted to prevent microbial contamination during microalgae production and for inducing geoduck broodstock spawning. The developed protocol for inducing broodstock spawning will improve geoduck gamete production and simplify hatchery operations. Geoduck is the most important commercial shellfish species in British Columbia. Unfortunately, commercial production is limited by the reliable supply of high quality hatchery-produced juveniles. Developing viable and sustainable culture protocols for this species will provide the industry with the needed seedstock to expand production. Benefits from expansion include new economic and employment opportunities for shellfish growers, seafood exporters, and First Nations communities plus a new source of sustainably produced seafood products. The UBC and British Columbia Pacific Oysters, Ltd. (BCPOL) have established a research collaboration to develop sustainable geoduck aquaculture production techniques through NSERC Engage and Engage Plus Grants. The preliminary research outcomes include: 
(1) design and construction of a prototype closed-culture system for controlled geoduck spawning; 
(2) fabrication of an elegant yet inexpensive seawater filtration system; 
(3) successful induction of geoduck broodstock spawning based on environmental manipulation among desiccation, temperature shifts, UV-filtered water stimulation, microalgal addition, and various combinations of the above; and

The initial research project activities focused on documenting the early embryonic and post-embryonic stages of geoduck to develop a hatchery production protocol. Geoduck broodstock were spawned through natural means and the larvae were reared until early juvenile stage. Primary results showed that after 50 days of culture from spawning, the juveniles reached approximately 7 to 12 mm shell length by feeding on microalgae such as chlorophyte, baccilariophyte, chrysophyte, and prymnesiophyte rich in protein with high level of omega-3 fatty acids. Survival rate was more than 90%, and no disease was found based on juvenile geoduck pathogen analysis conducted at Pacific Biological Station of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). The preliminary research results were very promising for the development of a viable commercial geoduck hatchery production system. The initial results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a viable commercial hatchery production of healthy and good quality geoduck seedstock in Canada to supply the needs of geoduck growers in British Columbia and the United States.

There are currently no mitigation measures that are 100% effective in removing or destroying NIS on cultured shellfish. The objective of this study was to assess shellfish transfers by the shellfish industry and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA ) biotoxin monitoring program as potential vectors for the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS), with particular focus on the European Green Crab, from the west to the east coast of Vancouver Island. The project quantified the potential risk of AIS introduction associated with current shellfish transfer protocols. Based on the results of the experimental and processor studies, the present conditions of licence do not eliminate the risk of transferring NIS. The gaps identified suggest that the intended reduction in propagule pressure is not being realized under current management/ regulatory strategies.

QUAHOG (MERCENARIA MERCENARIA) SEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION FOR REMOTE SETTING IN NOVA SCOTIA,,"University of British Columbia (UBC); Dalhousie University (Dalhousie U); Gulf Aquaculture Association (GAA)
","Quahog or hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria) is an edible marine bivalve mollusc commonly found along the eastern shores of North America and Central America, ranging from Prince Edward Island to the Yucatan Peninsula. Due to strong market demand, there has been an interest to expand the production of quahogs in the Maritimes. The Gulf Aquaculture Association (GAA), based in Northumberland Strait, requested assistance from Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and the Aquaculture Centre at Dalhousie University to assist the industry to improve quahog production in the province. Jesse Ronquillo (Principal Investigator) and Audrie-Jo McConkey (Shellfish Instructor and Algologist) devised innovative procedures in the spawning and larval rearing of quahog to produce the needed seedstock. Selected species of microalgae rich in highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) were mass-produced continuously in an inventive way to provide abundant and diversified source of live feeds to larvae until they reach pediveliger or eyed-larvae that were used by shellfish growers in Northumberland Strait for remote setting. Over 97 million seedstock were produced in about a month for the grow-out operations of the shellfish growers in Nova Scotia. The developed protocol for inducing broodstock spawning could improve quahog gamete production and simplify hatchery operations and management.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION EFFECTS ON SHELLFISH AQUACULTURE,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO); Island Scallops, Island Sea Farms Inc.; Taylor Shellfish Farms Canada; Limberis Seafoods Ltd.; Odyssey Shellfish Ltd.; Kyuquot Seafoods Ltd.","Rising atmospheric CO2 levels increases pCO2 in seawater, lowering the pH and causing ocean acidification which can profoundly affect shellfish aquaculture. Surface pCO2 can also rise in coastal regions due to the upwelling of deep, ancient water. While pCO2 levels are anticipated to rise consistently in the greater ocean due to elevated atmospheric CO2, coastal upwelling regions are already experiencing dramatic fluctuations in pCO2 that encompass the upper limits expected in the greater ocean in over 100 years’ time. Coincident with observations of enhanced pCO2 variation and potentially a higher average pCO2 experience along the BC and Washington State coastlines has been dramatic failures of shellfish aquaculture production both in the hatcheries and in ocean grow-out sites. This project was undertaken to begin collecting data and information in support of a causal link between reduced industry performance and pCO2, as well as to identify vulnerable developmental stages and physiologies. A clear signature of development was observed in the microarray data for both scallops and oysters. However, while there appeared to be a negative growth response to elevated pCO2 during some time periods, there was no consistent gene expression pattern differentiating treatments in the microarray data. However, it was found that there may be some level of acclimation possible, i.e., individuals that survive adverse conditions as larvae will perform better under those conditions as juveniles. This may point to an alternate larval rearing strategy that may benefit industry through the rearing of larvae under sub-lethal adverse conditions and selecting the most robust for settling and ocean ranching.",APR. 2011,JUL. 2013,"DFO – Aquaculture Collaborative Research and Development Program (DFO – ACRDP); Island Scallops; Island Sea Farms Inc.; Taylor Shellfish Farms Canada; Limberis Seafoods Ltd.; Odyssey Shellfish Ltd.; Kyuquot Seafoods Ltd.

"DEVELOPING A CARRYING CAPACITY FRAMEWORK FOR BAYNES SOUND, BRITISH COLUMBIA",,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO),"Shellfish aquaculture is an important activity in coastal environments. Successful culture of suspension-feeding shellfish relies heavily on the supply of phytoplankton food which is mainly controlled by hydrodynamic factors in estuaries with strong gradients in flushing characteristics (e.g., Baynes Sound, Strait of Georgia, B.C.). Large cultured bivalve populations may potentially deplete particles from the water column much faster than flushing or phytoplankton production can renew them on a local scale (farm depletion). Although re-suspension events or organic-rich sediments may provide a buffer against a fluctuating planktonic food supply, areas prone to re-suspension of silt-laden flocs may shutdown feeding of shellfish. The main objective of this project is to develop a carrying capacity model for shellfish production in Baynes Sound. The project will focus on establishing a particulate budget for the Sound and providing a real-time assessment of the current state of benthic and pelagic conditions in support of the development of siting criteria. Longer term goals involve developing circulation and nutrient models that describe the hydrodynamic and biological controls on particulate concentrations in Baynes Sound. These models will be coupled with shellfish assimilative estimates to determine the influence of shellfish production on benthic and water column quality.

In order to establish hatcheryrearing protocols of a cultured bivalve species, it is necessary to examine a number of biotic and abiotic factors, such as temperature, diet quality, and diet quantity. This research aimed to determine optimal temperature, microalgal diets, and feeding rations for P. generosa larvae and seed. Optimum microalgal diets were identified for larval and young juvenile geoduck clams. Optimum temperature and rations were identified for various size classes of young juvenile clams. These results will improve the reliability and production capacity of geoduck hatcheries in British Columbia and will help alleviate the hatchery bottleneck in the culture of geoduck clams.

HIGHER TROPHIC LEVEL RESPONSES TO SHELLFISH AQUACULTURE HABITAT MODIFICATIONS,,Vancouver Island University (VIU); University of Victoria (UVic),"These findings will indicate how, and to what extent, juvenile salmonids and intertidal fish are utilizing shellfish aquaculture structures as habitat with potential implications for shellfish aquaculture practices and regulations. They will also provide information on the potential value of shellfish aquaculture structures as rearing and feeding habitats for juvenile Pacific salmon in this region. Intertidal shellfish farms are prominent on the shoreline of Baynes Sound, British Columbia. In this region, approximately 50% of Manila Clams and 30% of Pacific Oysters produced by the province are grown. Additionally, many rivers and streams run into this area, providing valuable Pacific salmon spawning habitat from which juvenile salmon then emerge and use the nearshore areas to feed and grow. The goal of this project is to determine the habitat value of intertidal shellfish aquaculture tenures for juvenile salmonids and intertidal fish communities. During the spring/summer of 2014, juvenile salmonids and intertidal fish were sampled at shellfish leases and nearby reference sites. Fish species, abundance, and stomach contents will be analyzed for spatial and temporal trends. Site attributes such as habitat complexity and vegetation will also be investigated. Fish community parameters to be compared include, juvenile/adult ratio, species diversity and richness, body size by species, and functional diversity. Functional diversity is essentially a measure of ecosystem integrity based on the characteristics of the individuals found in the selected habitat. Given the increased shoreline complexity associated with shellfish aquaculture, we expect shellfish tenures to provide significant habitat value to fish.

We will trial these systems for use in the classroom (North Island College, University of Victoria), and as “interactive” features in long term aquaculture displays such as those developed in the Comox Valley Visitors Centre, the Ucluelet Aquarium, the Campbell River Discovery Passage Aquarium, and the Vancouver Public Aquarium. The attraction of a “joystick” that allows camera movement, including deployment into a cage of fish and along the outer edge of a stack of oyster trays, will engage a public that generally has a limited perception of what aquaculture is all about.

CAPTURING SOCIAL VALUES IN OCEAN MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING: NEW TOOLS FOR NEW TIMES,,Vancouver Island University (VIU); BC Commercial Fishing Caucus; Pacific Marine Analysis and Research Association,"Healthy marine social-ecological systems, including aquaculture and fisheries, are significant to the social and economic wellbeing of coastal communities. However, marine socioecological systems are threatened by human-caused pressures. A common response to these pressures has been an increase in participatory management and planning processes, intended to accommodate and integrate input from all sectors. One of the key challenges to this happening is the current reliance on economic values as proxies for human socio-cultural values and/or the omission of key social and cultural considerations. While most agree that social values are important, gathering information on people’s values regarding the ocean has proved to be challenging. We completed a pilot study using the “Q-method” to capture social values in the seafood sector in Campbell River, B.C. The Q-method combines qualitative and quantitative information and is increasingly used to explore subjective understandings of people in resource management contexts. This research aimed to capture and categorize people’s social values/ preferences relative to seafood and the ocean. The results illustrate the complexity and inter-relatedness of values, that values do no align neatly with sub-sector (e.g., harvesting, processing, fisheries, aquaculture, etc.), and the importance of context to social values related to seafood and the ocean. We found that differences are not polarized into opposing “for” or “against” positions but are complex and nuanced. Our study also demonstrates that individuals’ social values do not align within seafood sub-sectors (e.g., fishing, aquaculture, processing, retail, etc.) but rather cut across sets of preferences.

Early results from this project are promising for sea cucumber aquaculture in BC. Juvenile individuals have shown good growth and survival when raised in benthic cages both on and away from an existing deep-water oyster farm. When co-cultured with oysters, the nutrient rich benthic habitat at these sites may allow for higher growth rates and stocking densities. High densities of sea cucumbers often found at existing aquaculture sites may help to ameliorate some of the nutrient loading and associated environmental impacts of shellfish aquaculture.

With the support of the British Columbia salmon aquaculture industry, the Harmful Algae Monitoring Program (HAMP) was established in 1999 as a community program to address the devastating effect of harmful algae on farmed fish. Researchers needed to identify certain HAB species, cultivate these species for study, and analyze previous HAMP data to investigate potential trends between HABs and environmental parameters. Five harmful algal species (with 17 strains in total) were isolated and identified through microscope observation and genetic analysis. These species are in culture at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS), as well as archived with the Canadian Centre for the Culture of Microorganisms at the University of British Columbia, allowing for potential future studies on algal genetics, toxin production, and non-microscopic methods of harmful algae detection. Harmful algal identification posters were created to assist industry in identifying various HAB species. In addition, the analysis of the data collected by the HAMP over the last thirteen years has shown some correlations between various environmental variables and blooms of particular harmful algae species.
