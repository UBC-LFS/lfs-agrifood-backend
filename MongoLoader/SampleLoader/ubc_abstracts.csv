Inspection of food quality and safety using hyperspectral imaging technique,"Producers, processors and ultimately Canadian consumers stand to benefit from the development of automated, non-destructive, rapid, high-throughput and accurate techniques for on-line inspection of food quality and safety in the food production industry. Continuous process monitoring would enable a producer to maximize the value and minimize the waste when it comes to utilization of raw materials and assurance of production quality; hence, offering consumers with a product of greater nutritional value at a lower cost. High-capacity process monitoring requires non-contact optical techniques, which uses digital imaging and molecular spectroscopy. The applicant’s NSERC Discovery Grant, Collaborative Research and Development Grant, and Engage Grant research programs focus on the application of these methodologies for the inspection of food quality and safety.

This proposal therefore aims to request for funds to acquire a hyperspectral imaging platform to be used by a team of UBC research groups in Food Science, Chemistry, and Chemical & Biological Engineering. This research project in particular will apply spectrochemical and 2D optical image processing to develop a reliable and objective inspection system capable of monitoring food quality and safety in a rapid and non-destructive manner. Availability of such a hyperspectral imaging system will minimize reliance on human inspection of food quality and safety during food production and delivery and establish food external and compositional attributes. Overall, the combination of spectral and imaging information will enable an efficient new mean for the reliable on-line inspection of the quality and safety of fruit and meat. 

It is expected that the research using the hyperspectral imaging system will provide sufficient information on the normal and abnormal variance in the composition of bulk commodity food items. Furthermore, research in the classification of spectral and morphological materials will provide unique opportunities to train highly qualified personnel in Canada to become leaders with expertise in the application of spectroscopic-based instrumental technologies, both as research tools, and as a mean to complement traditional methods for the determination of food quality and safety."
Evaluating the impact of Greater Vancouver food bank society's community food hubs program,"Canadians living in poverty have higher risks of nutrition-related diseases like type2 diabetes and heart disease. Over a million Canadians also experience stress, hunger and poor health because they cannot afford healthy food. Each week, 28,000 people rely on food from the Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society (GVFBS) to help feed their families. Yet, we do not know much about people who come to the food bank, including what health issues they face, what makes it difficult for them to eat a healthy diet or how food banks can help them improve their health.

GVFBS is now changing how they work by providing food that is more nutritious and inviting members to choose their own foods, instead of handing out a set basket of foods. They are moving programs into larger, brighter and more convenient spaces called food hubs where members can buy fresh, affordable fruits and vegetables while picking up other free foods and household items. GVFBS is also partnering with community organizations to provide nutrition education and health screenings like blood pressure testing and to help connect members to other valuable services.

This research project will test how well the new community food hub programs work. The main goals are to see if food hubs help members get more fruits and vegetables and less salt in their diet or help reduce hunger by linking members with more reliable sources of healthy food. We will conduct focus groups and surveys to learn how food hubs can help people access healthy foods and improve their overall health.

This project will make important changes that benefit the health of Canadians at high risk of chronic diseases. We will share lessons from Vancouver with food banks, policy makers and researchers across the country and will build on the longstanding relationships food banks have in their communities to improve access to healthy food and services that promote good health, provided with dignity and respect.

NSERC industrial research chair in dairy cattle welfare - Research,"The objective of the proposed research program is to produce science-based recommendations that will allow producers to promote the welfare of their dairy cattle. The research will focus on two important areas: (1) optimizing welfare during the transitions in diet and management that occur over a dairy cow's life; and (2) improving health through improvements in management and facility design. Dairy cows experience several transitions over their life. These include weaning (calves are switched from milk to starter feed and starter feed to forage), the onset of lactation, and the cessation of lactation. Research is needed to manage these transitions with minimum stress for the animal. The work will also build upon existing research on cow health and facility design (especially cow comfort, flooring, feeder and stall design) to better understand how housing conditions contribute to the risk of disease in cattle such as lameness, mastitis and metritis. This understanding will form the basis of science-based recommendations to dairy producers for improved facility design.

The UBC Animal Welfare Program's faculty, along with students, post-doctoral fellows, visiting researchers and adjunct professors, compose the world's foremost research group working on cattle welfare and behaviour. Studies will be conducted at the state-of-the-art UBC Dairy Education and Research Centre in Agassiz, British Columbia, recognized as one of the leading dairy research facilities in the world. This facility is a fully operational dairy farm, but managed and designed to support dairy research and technology transfer."
Enhancement of vitamin B12 content in yoghurt using fortification strategies and vitamin producing probiotics,"Dairy products are the leading food sources of vitamin B12. The regular consumption of dairy products is a key contributor to vitamin B12 status compared to the consumption of eggs or meat. The consumption of dairy products in Canada however is below the recommended daily intake of two servings. This occurrence corresponds to national survey data reporting a high rate of vitamin B12 inadequacy in the general population. Food fortification is an effective strategy to increase the intake of a nutrient that is less abundant in the diet. Because vitamin B12 is best absorbed from milk products compared to other food products, yoghurt seems to be an ideal food vehicle for vitamin B12 fortification to improve dietary vitamin B12 intakes. There are no vitamin B12 fortified foods in Canada, other than simulated dairy and meat products. Adults aged > 50 years, which make up 37% of Canadians, are recommended to meet their daily vitamin B12 requirements mainly through consumption of fortified foods and/or dietary supplements (i.e., sources of isolated vitamin B12), due to the age-related decrease in absorption capacity of food-bound vitamin B-12. In light of the high rate of vitamin B12 inadequacy in the general population, fortifying dairy products with vitamin B12 could fill a gap that presently exists in the diet of Canadians, and more so in the growing older population. We aim to study whether the consumption of B12-fortified yoghurt enables older adults to achieve optimal vitamin B12 status. Probiotics are beneficial for a healthy gastrointestinal system and are mostly found in dairy products. We aim to compare the efficacy of yoghurt fortified with isolated vitamin B12 versus vitamin B12 producing probiotics on improving vitamin B12 status in older adults. The outcomes of this project will help to promote the consumption of dairy – as a natural and excellent food source of bioavailable vitamin B12 and as a novel food product – with the overall goal to reduce the high rates of suboptimal vitamin B12 status in Canadians."
Cut-point analysis of vitamin B12 deficiency indicators for early diagnosis of functional impairments in children,"Vitamin B12 deficiency in early childhood can result in severe and permanent adverse health consequences. There is also a lack of an accurate tool for vitamin 812 deficiency diagnosis in children. Blood vitamin B12 levels are evaluated against adult normal values, yet early consequences may occur before blood levels appear to be ""abnormal"". Our research team recently developed a new method to measure a more sensitive marker of vitamin B12 deficiency. By comparing the new method with clinical vitamin B12 testing in blood of at-risk children, we aim to define levels of vitamin B12 deficiency that warrant early treatment."
Exploring the role of in-school food advertising and adolescent dietary outcomes,"The prevalence of obesity and related chronic diseases among Canadian youth has risen significantly over the past several decades, in part because of poor dietary patterns. While many factors influence diet, food and beverage advertising is thought to be important because of its significant association with the food preferences and choices of youth. These associations are not surprising given that many youth lack the necessary cognitive abilities to understand and/or resist the persuasive intent of advertising. To date, minimal research has explored whether associations between food advertising and dietary outcomes extend to settings outside the home, and none have looked at these relations within the context of Canadian schools where youth spend much of their day. Without this information, employing a multi-sectoral approach to reduce the negative impact of advertising on youth is unlikely. The purpose of this proposal is two-fold. First, all in-school food advertising will be documented and described within a sample of Vancouver schools. Second, connections between school-level food advertising and student level dietary outcomes will be examined. These objectives will be met by developing and piloting a measurement tool and coding protocol to capture all in-school food advertising and by using multilevel statistical methods to analyze existing data from the CIHR-funded Food Practices on School Days Study, a cross-sectional study (n~ 1,000) that builds on a larger 5-year SSHRC Community University Research Alliance program that was funded to initiate a variety of food system and curricular initiatives in Vancouver Schools (K-12). Research findings will: provide insight into the prevalence of food and beverage advertising within Vancouver schools; help to determine associations between food and beverage advertising and the dietary outcomes of youth; and guide future school-based interventions and/or policy decisions for improving dietary outcomes among youth."

UBC nutritional biomarker laboratory,"Vitamin adequacy means a sufficient yet not overly high intake of these essential nutrients that is linked to the lowest risk of disease development. Dr. Lamers has been working on defining B-vitamin adequacy and strategies for disease prevention for 15 years. Her results help our understanding of the role of B-vitamins in disease development and in the elaboration of sensitive and simple tools for diagnosing B-vitamin deficiencies. Dr. Lamers' research outcomes are being translated into clinical practice and are disseminated in the general public to increase awareness about potential causes and risks of vitamin deficiencies. 

The requested infrastructure will complement Dr. Lamers' established and CFI funded state-of-the-art facility using cutting-edge technology for determining vitamins and related metabolites in study samples. The equipment will enhance her productivity, benefit other researchers at her institutions and in the Canadian community, support the training of highly skilled and motivated young scientists, and allow the expansion of established national and international collaborations. The new infrastructure will allow the sustainability of Dr. Lamers' innovative research program on defining the functional consequences of B-vitamin inadequacy and improving available assessment tools for diagnosing vitamin B-12 deficiency in pregnancy and infancy. The results of all research projects are truly translational and have the potential to be commercialized.

Identification of novel genetic factors contributing to the significance of listeria monocytogenes as a foodborne pathogen,"The provision of safe, wholesome foods is essential for the well-being of humans. In Canada, the safety of our foods was recently questioned following four major outbreaks of foodbome disease in 2008, the most notable of which resulted in the deaths of23 Canadians who consumed deli meats contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. In the wake of these events, an independent panel of experts produced the Weatherill Report detailing 57 recommendations to improve food safety. Despite the ongoing implementation of these recommendations, issues with L. monocytogenes persist. While recalls of contaminated foods suggests the food safety system is working, it also demonstrates ineffective control at the food processor level. The objective of this research program is to identify novel mechanisms enabling L. monocytogenes to persist for long periods in food production environments, survive in food, and, ultimately, cause human disease. Research will focus on the characterisation of genes contributing to survival against food chain stresses (e.g. sanitizers, low water activity, acid, etc.). Also, mechanisms associated with cold adaptation, growth, and survival will be investigated. Knowledge gained from will provide an improved understanding of how L. monocytogenes persists in foods and food production environments, enabling the development of new and improved intervention strategies. In addition, this program will prepare participating students to address Canada's food safety issues."
Identification and characterization of indigenous B.C. wine yeast strains,"In competitive wine markets, British Columbian (BC) wineries must create high-value wines that express the unique character, or terroir, of their region. Wines are produced by inoculated fermentation with commercial strains of the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) or by spontaneous fermentation, which relies on yeast residing on grapes and winery equipment. Spontaneous fermentations are risky but can produce organoleptically complex wines if indigenous yeast species dominate the fermentation. The goal of my research is to identify indigenous yeast present in BC vineyards with enological potential that showcase BC terroir. Since 2013, we have collaborated with two BC wineries that perform Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir spontaneous fermentations. Concurrent with winery fermentations, we harvested the same grape varietals and fermented them in the lab. We isolated S. cerevisiae strains from winery and vineyard fermentations, performed microsatellite profiling and compared the data to a microsatellite database that we compiled of over 120 commercial S. cerevisiae wine yeast strains. Commercial strains were ubiquitous in the winery fermentations whereas ~200 distinct S. cerevisiae microsatellite genotypes were isolated from our vineyard fermentations. We also identified Saccharomyces bayanus (S. bayanus) as a prominent yeast species in the Pinot Gris fermentations. 
Aim 1. Phenotypic profiling of S. cerevisiae strains isolated from spontaneous fermentations. Bayesian clustering analysis of our 200 S. cerevisiae strains revealed 12 population clusters. We will perform small scale fermentations with representative strains from each cluster. Strains with vigorous fermentation profiles will be analyzed for positive flavor compounds. Phenotypic analysis of traits important for wine production and whole genome sequencing of strains with enological potential will be performed.
Aim 2. Identification of yeast species during spontaneous fermentation. Nonconventional yeasts such as Metschnikowia are found in spontaneous fermentations and contribute sensorial complexity to the wine. We will identify non-Saccharomyces species present in our winery and vineyard fermentations by direct DNA extraction from wine samples and Illumina next generation sequencing. Our goal is to analyze the contribution of nonconventional yeast to the winery and vineyard fermentations.
Aim 3. Characterize the potential of S. bayanus and non-Saccharomyces yeasts in wine fermentation. We isolated 4 unique strains of S. bayanus that dominated both winery and vineyard Pinot Gris fermentations. S. bayanus performs well in low temperature fermentations and produces wines with less acetic acid and higher aromatic intensity. S. bayanus and non-Saccharomyces strains will be co-inoculated with S. cerevisiae strains to identify ideal strain combinations for high quality wine production.

Identification and characterization of novel genetic factors contributing to the significance of listeria monocytogenes as a foodborne pathogen,"The perils of pathogen-contaminated food are fresh in the minds of many Canadians, and stem from the recent outbreak linked to widespread distribution of E. coli 0157:H7 contaminated beef products across North America. Correspondingly, consequences of food safety failures are of considerable interest to Canadians. Regarding Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), 99% of listeriosis cases are estimated to derive from contaminated food. Therefore, improved mitigation strategies aimed at more effective control of Lm are required to reduce recalls and rates of listeriosis. To this end, my research program aims to identify factors contributing to food chain survival that enable more effective Lm mitigation. At this time, we are focusing on a recently discovered genomic island (LGI1) reported in deli meat and BC seafood. This islet encodes putative stress response, quaternary ammonium compound, and virulence genes. Notably, strains carrying LGI1 were recently shown to form a new epidemic clone (ECV), and have caused human disease in Canada since 1988. To elucidate whether LGI1 genes contribute to food chain survival and/or virulence, my research program will use traditional and molecular approaches to address hypotheses. In short, we will compare Lm 1/2a serotype strains lacking LGI1 to 1/2a strains possessing LGI1 to see if differences exist in the ability to tolerate food-related stress (acidic pH, high salt) and sanitizers. Similarly, we will determine if Lm having LGI1 adhere to food surfaces and enterocytes more effectively. To compliment these traditional food microbiology approaches, my program will use qPCR and targeted gene deletion/complementation to confirm LGI1 contributions. As well, since LGI1 encodes an alternate sigma factor and a two-component regulator, RNA sequencing will be employed to investigate possible stress response/regulatory differences in strains encoding LGI1. This research program will contribute new knowledge regarding the role of LGI1. Considering its association with clinical listeriosis in Canada, such insight is critical, and will provide a foundation from which new and/or improved control strategies will evolve."
Support for role of the nuclear pore in Ty1 transposition,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) orchestrates cargo between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm and regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. NPC proteins, or nucleoporins (Nups) are required for integration of retroviral DNA into the genome. We use the Tyl retrotransposon of the budding yeast 5accharomyces cerevisiae (5. cerevisiae) as a model system to study retroviral integration because retrotransposons are the progenitors of retroviruses and have conserved integrase (IN) enzymes. Ty1 elements are targeted by Ty1-IN upstream of RNA Polymerase (Pol) Ill transcribed genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Recent evidence that 5. cerevisiae tRNA genes are recruited to the NPC during active transcription prompted us to examine the role of the NPC in Ty1 transposition. We have found that mutation of components of the NPC nuclear basket (Mlp1, Mlp2, Nup1, Nup2 and Nup60) have defects in Ty1 mobility and Ty1 element insertion into the genome. We will perform genome-wide mapping of Ty1 insertions in a variety of mutants of the nuclear basket proteins to determine how these mutations affect Ty1 insertion. Genome-wide mapping requires induction of Ty1 insertion in each mutant using a barcoded Ty1 element, followed by extraction of genomic DNA, amplification of the de novo Ty1 insertions (with the barcoded Ty1 element) and illumina sequencing to identify the insertion position. The sequencing will be performed at the UBC Sequencing and Bioinformatics Consortium (http://sequencing.ubc.ca)."
NSERC Industrial Research in Dairy Cattle Welfare,"UBC proudly partners with the Dairy Farmers of Canada and a team of other industrial sponsors working within Canada's dairy sector to support five more years (Years 15 to 20 in total) of research on dairy cattle welfare. UBC's Animal Welfare Program was created as an NSERC Industrial Research Chair in 1997 and has since grown to become the world's leading research group working on dairy cattle welfare. The current proposal builds upon these strong foundations to produce science-based recommendations that dairy producers can use to promote the health, welfare, and productivity of their cattle. Our planned research will focus on important welfare concerns of practical interest to the dairy industry. The five areas are: 1) dietary and management transitions of calves and growing heifers, 2) access to pasture and alternative outdoor areas, 3) reimagining indoor housing for cattle, 4) identification of risk factors for poor cow comfort and disease on commercial farms and, 5) identify simple outcome-based welfare measures for producer self-assessment.

The funding from our partners will allow for the creation of a new senior research associate position, with the aim of grooming a suitable candidate for eventual hire as a new faculty member within our cattle welfare team. This new position will cement the Animal Welfare Program's reputation as the world's leading research unit working in this area, and strengthens the position of the Canadian dairy industry in addressing the increasingly important issues around social sustainability of farm practices.

Studies will continue to be conducted on commercial dairy farms and at the state-of-the-art UBC Dairy Education and Research Centre in Agassiz, British Columbia, recognized as one of the leading dairy research facilities in the world. This facility is a fully operational dairy farm, managed and designed to support dairy research and technology transfer.

Integrated cardiorespiratory physiology,"I study the heart, an organ that powers the cardiorespiratory system. I aim to discover mechanisms and unifying concepts that explain how different cardiac designs assist animals to live at a high environmental temperature or with low (or no) O2. One theme of my research program will provide new insights into specialized ion channels in cardiac cell membranes that are key to allowing an animal’s heartbeat to be automatic and rhythmic. We will investigate how the heartbeat is physiologically initiated and controlled when these channels open for ion movements. Also, a phylogenetic tree of the molecular structure of these ion channels will be created for hagfish (representatives of earliest chordates), cartilaginous fishes (at the base of the vertebrate lineage) and lungfish (at the base of the tetrapod lineage). A second theme builds on our physiological studies of rainbow trout populations that, through natural selection or hatchery practices, live at unusually high temperatures for this species. We will explore molecular mechanisms (changes to DNA and in RNA expression) that allow regular heartbeats at what would be normally a supra-optimal temperature for the species. By extension, we will see if Antarctic and Arctic fishes can express a new cardiac design and maintain physiological function after being warmed to temperatures realistic for global climate change. Hemoglobin-free icefish will be studied in Antarctica (an expedition funded by the USA’s National Science Foundation), while Arctic cod will be shipped to and acclimated in UBC’s new aquatic facility. Lastly, to enlighten how the first vertebrates may have developed a more secure O2 supply for their heart, we will complete our comprehensive phylogenetic and physiological exploration of the coronary circulation in cartilaginous fishes. Because all animals do not possess a coronary circulation and by studying representatives of basal vertebrates in which the coronary circulation first appeared, we will identify factors that likely drove the evolution of an O2 delivery system that better secures heart function when it must continue beating in extreme conditions. Thus, my research program will generate basic morphological, physiological and molecular information that help explain how cardiac structure and function ensure an adequate O2 supply for an animal. This information is of great significance to Canadians given the increased warming of our Arctic Ocean and the eutrophication our freshwater."
Development of paper-based immunoassays to detect food chemical hazards,"Rapid, cost-effective, and accurate detection of food chemical hazards can offer an important means to improve food safety and economic benefit of biotechnology industry in Canada. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic strip assay are two representative immunoassays that have been widely applied for the detection of food chemical hazards. However, conventional ELISA requires large volumes of analytes and reagents, and the time required for incubation and blocking steps are long. Further, the fabrication of immunochromatographic strip is complicated and the price of a single test is high. In this NSERC CRD project, we propose to develop low-cost paper-based immunoassays to improve the detection of food chemical hazards. As two representative techniques to pattern paper, photolithography and wax screen printing will be applied to fabricate microzone on paper for the development of both competitive and sandwich ELISA assays to detect selective veterinary drug residues and allergens, respectively. In addition, inkjet printing technique will be applied to fabricate microfluidic paper-based immunochromatographic strips for the detection of the aforementioned food chemical hazards in a ""one-step"" procedure. The developed paper-based immunoassays for the detection of food chemical hazards offer a few major advantages over the conventional immunoassays. They are more rapid, high-throughput, and only require small amount of samples, reagents, and simple equipment. The availability of this technology will provide Canadian manufactures with unprecedented insight and advantages in the development of the next-generation immunoassays. Continuous information certifying the performance quality of advanced immunoassays will secure the premier position of Canadian agri-food diagnostic products in the world marketplace. Moreover, the knowledge developed in the areas of patterned paper along with microfluidic ""lab-on-a-chip"" technique represent an advance of fundamental importance to the field of analytical chemistry that applied in agricultural, food, and biotechnology industry."
"Detection, validation, and assessment of risks implied by the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state of enteric bacterial pathogens in fresh produce","Increased consumption, large-scale production and efficient distribution of fresh produce have contributed to an increase in the number of illness outbreaks caused by fresh fruits and vegetables. Comprehensive data about the prevalence of bacterial pathogens is essential for the development of accurate risk assessments and relevant quality control systems for fresh produce. None of the analytical methods commonly used for the analysis of fresh produce can account for bacterial pathogens in physiological states that preclude detection, notably the viable but non-culturable state (VBNC). We will develop a new diagnostic assay by modification of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to incorporate intercalating dye to enable the rapid and sensitive detection of both viable and VBNC Salmonella and Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC) in fresh produce. Once the diagnostic assay is developed, assay performance will be validated and field trials and postharvest study will be conducted to examine the survival of VBNC cells and to determine the risk posed by VBNC Salmonella and STEC on lettuce. This research will provide a more rapid, lower-cost, and easily interpreted diagnostic assay to improve produce safety. The acquired knowledge of risk implied by the survival of VBNC Salmonella and STEC on fresh produce will improve fresh produce safety by 1) ensuring produce grown in California and the USA meets or exceeds industry and regulatory food safety standards and 2) reducing foodborne illness caused by the consumption of contaminated fresh produce."
Specialty birds research fund,"The purpose of this research fund is to assist the BC Specialty Bird Industry to be competitive, to overcome constraints to growth, and to be sustainable by facilitating, funding and coordinating research in the areas of economics and marketing, biology and genetics, environment, production management, and food science."
Integrative cardiorespiratory physiology,"The cardiovascular system, as a critical life support system, plays a key role in how vertebrates tolerate or adapt to diverse ecological niches. My long-term research aim is to define underlying mechanisms and unifying concepts that explain cardiovascular diversity and phenotypic plasticity among lower vertebrates, and especially in fishes. A central question is: What cardiovascular features allow an animal to tolerate a particular environmental condition? The approach uses in vivo and in vitro (organ, tissue and cellular) intervention studies (emphasizing exercise, 02, pH, temperature and pharmacological agents), as well as species comparisons, and reveals much about the animal as a whole, more so if mechanisms setting the limits for maximum cardiac performance are understood. One research theme focuses on why fish stop swimming, especially at warm temperatures. Experiments will test the working hypothesis that 02 supply to the heart becomes limited during extreme exercise, causing fish to stop swimming. Experiments include innovative measurements of 02 in venous blood during swimming and assessments of maximum heart performance under conditions that simulate those occurring in venous blood near fatigue. A second research theme examines cardiovascular regulation when an animal has no 02 (anoxia). Experiments will test the working hypothesis that anoxic turtles switch from central (neural) to local (tissue-specific) cardiovascular controls as they tum down metabolism to pilot light status, whereas anoxic crucian carp maintain normal cardiac activity to avoid both acidosis and ethanol intoxication. The third research theme integrates mechanistic studies of ion trafficking in cardiac cells, seeking answers to how anoxic crucian carp hearts function normally, how anoxic turtles and common carp drastically reduce heart rate, how adrenaline may protect acidotic/hypoxic trout hearts, and why heart rate in fish rarely exceeds 120 bpm. A new emphasis on ion trafficking is important because our work, and that of others, is showing that the modulation of ion trafficking allows lower vertebrates alter cardiac excitability in response to the environmental challenges that they routinely face, and we study."
Trainee travel project - B-vitamins in breast milk,"After four years studying vitamins A and E in human milk, I realized that the mother-infant dyad could be extensively further studied and due to that my short term career goal is to broaden my knowledge on human milk nutritional composition, in order to achieve a long term goal that is being able to work with public policies related to breastfeeding practice. To achieve these goals, my project aims to expand my knowledge on the methodological approaches involved in the analysis of vitamins in human milk and my chosen training environment is the USDA Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC)."
Molecular genetics of baculovirus transcription factors,"Baculoviruses are insect specific pathogens that are currently been used around the world as biological insect control agents that are not harmful to the environment. Baculoviruses are extremely specific for the insects they infect and are not harmful to humans. The research being performed in this study is determining the molecular basis of how baculoviruses infect and kill pest insects. We will be studying the key genes that control and regulate the virus life cycle. These genes are essential for the virus and determining how these genes work will provide insights into what makes a virus more or less virulent and also why a virus can infect one insect but not another. These studies will provide fundamental knowledge about how viruses infect and kill cells, which is applicable to many areas of science including human medicine. In addition, these studies may lead to improved methods of using insect diseases instead of chemical pesticides to control economically important insect pests."
Unrestricted Research Funds,Salmon samples have been collected as part of an Aquanet funded project. A portion of each fish has been vacuum packaged and has been in frozen storage. The flesh samples will be visually evaluated for color using the Roche SalmoFan as well as with a Minolta reflectance spectrophotometer. Texture of raw and cooked flesh samples will be measured with a Texture Analyzer.
Suboptimal riboflavin status in women of childbearing age? Is dairy a potential solution?,"Dairy products are a leading source of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) in the Canadian diet. Riboflavin is not generally thought to be lacking in Canadians' diets, but in a small pilot study we showed that that a substantial proportion (about 40%) of young women (18-45 y) in Vancouver had low blood levels of riboflavin. Low riboflavin may lead to anemia and high blood pressure in some people. In order to confirm these findings we propose collecting blood samples to measure riboflavin status in a larger group of women, to determine the extent of the problem. We aim to conduct the study in White and Chinese women as it is reported that Chinese people are less likely to consume dairy products and thus may be at higher risk of low blood riboflavin than Whites. We will also examine if higher dairy intake is related to better blood riboflavin levels. Finally we will see if low blood riboflavin is linked to high blood pressure and anemia.

If this study confirms that riboflavin levels in blood are low in this sample of Canadian women, an increased dairy consumption should be encouraged in this group to ensure an adequate riboflavin intake."
Quantification and mitigation of green house gas emissions from high value agricultural production systems in B.C.,"Agriculture is a significant source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus a serious concern regarding future climate change. Any substantial efforts to mitigate such effects demands robust estimates of actual GHG emissions from different cropping systems. While a significant effort has been made during the last two decades in measuring GHG emissions in agricultural production systems including grasslands, in Ontario, Quebec and Prairies, only infrequent and short-duration measurements have been attempted in BC. As a result, no credible annual estimates of net GHG emissions, based on actual measurements, are available for major cropping systems in BC. We will quantify actual emissions associated with major crop production systems in in BC, particularly the Fraser valley, and develop a set of Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce climate impacts from agricultural production. Measurements will be made using the eddy-covariance technique on farm-scale and using automated and manual chamber measurements on trial plots. We will also measure carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, which, along with energy and material inputs in various on-farm activities, will provide us estimates of net GHG budgets. This will help us to determine the BMPs to achieve increased crop production and N-use efficiency while minimizing GHG emissions. The data will be used to parameterize the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model and the parameterized model will be used to estimate landscape-scale GHG emissions and the effects of expected climate change. The outcome of this research will provide accurate and previously unavailable annual estimates of GHG emissions in important crop production systems, and make new GHG mitigation information freely available to Canadian producers, policy makers and the scientific community. The project will benefit Canada by moving it away from Tier 1 'default' or Tier 2 'country-defined' emission factors towards Tier 3 'higher order (modelled and measurement-based)' emission factors in reporting to the IPCC the GHG emissions in agriculture."
The feasibility of using dried black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) in laying hen diets,"Soybean is the main source of protein in poultry diets while its production results in significant global greenhouse gas emissions. A potential substitute for the use of soybean could be insects like black soldier fly larvae (BSFL; rich in protein and fat) produced from food wastage. Dried BSFL has been approved by CFIA for use in broiler diets but has not yet been approved to be used in laying hen diets in Canada because of the lack of required data. 
A feeding trial with BSFL (control, 10%, 20%) will be carried out to assess the feasibility and safety of the use of larvae in layer diets. Results of our study would facilitate the registration of dried BSFL as a feedstuff in layer diets by Enterra Feed Corporation. Such act would provide a channel for recycling food waste, provide an environmentally friendly feedstuff for egg farmers, promote sustainable agriculture, and cut down on global emissions.

Effects of social experience on calf behaviour,"The welfare of animals, especially those used in food production, has become an area of increasing social concern. A research priority cited repeatedly by agricultural and other animal-user groups is the development of methodology for a more objective assessment of animal well-being. My proposal involves developing methods for the scientific study of animal welfare that can later be applied to socially and economically important issues in housing and management of farm animals. One of the most important conceptual innovations in animal welfare science over the past 5 years has been to use changes in cognitive functioning to provide insights into affective states. Borrowing on experimental approaches designed to assess depression in humans, and more recently modified for use in laboratory animals, my research will test the effects of changes in affective states (such as those associated with social isolation) on how animals respond to ambiguous stimuli. Dairy calves are typically housed in individual pens or hutches, but a growing body of literature on rats is showing that rearing animals with this level of social isolation can result in profound cognitive deficits, as characterized by problems in memory and learning tasks. The proposed research is the first ever to apply these ideas and approaches from the laboratory animal literature to farm animals where individual housing systems are common. The proposed experiments will contribute to the basic literature on the effects of social experience on cognitive development, and may have profound implications for our understanding of the welfare of animals kept in individual housing systems, common in some agricultural systems. This research will provide basic insights into calf welfare, and pave the way for more applied research that will be of practical relevance to dairy producers, in developing rearing methods that provide improvements to both the calf and to the productivity of the farm. The funds will go toward training of young scientists to help meet a growing demand for academics, veterinarians and other professionals with expertise in animal welfare research."
Infrared Thermography Camera: A non-invasive tool to aid in the development of science based solutions for improving the welfare of animals,"The overall aim of the UBC Animal Welfare Program is to improve the lives of animals through research, teaching and outreach. The aim of this specific proposal is to request funds to purchase an Infrared Camera and two lenses that will allow for objective non-invasive measurement of changes in peripheral skin and/or eye temperature of animals before, during and after an environmental or physiological stressor. Changes in skin and eye temperature have been used to assess both disease (i.e. fever associated with infectious diseases or inflammatory issues) and emotional states of the animals. The farm animal industries are under increasing pressure to minimize the pain and distress farm animals experience when exposed to routine management procedures such as castration, dehorning, or transport. To date the majority of research in this area has focused on physiological changes that require blood sampling, which requires physical restraint and likely some discomfort. In contrast the infrared technology requested is non-invasive and allows for real-time measurements. Our first aim is to use this non-invasive method to improve our understanding the effects of routine management practices on animal emotions (e.g. fear) and to determine if refinements in how these practices can aid in mitigating these extent to which animals express these negative emotions. With the exception of fear, few emotions have been described in farm animals despite a growing body of evidence suggesting that they are able to experience a very complicated emotional life. There is also a growing body of evidence that animals differ in their ability to cope with negative experiences. Thus, our second aim is to assess the relationship between consistent individual differences in behaviour, frequently referred as 'personality traits', and differences in the intensity of the stress response. Collectively these lines of research will lead to a better understanding of individual variation and most importantly of its consequences on the welfare of farm animals. Although it is commonly assumed that challenging situations are individually perceived and consequently result in different types of responses by different animals (within the same species) little consideration have been taken regarding individual characteristics within a farm animal species. Improved understanding of individual responses at the behavioural and physiological level is an important step in understanding the individual emotional life of farm animals. The purchase of the infrared camera is an important necessary step in achieving these aims."
"Deficit irrigation and crop size adjustment strategies for improving the
concentration of aromatic compounds in white grapes in British Columbia
climates","In white wines, the wine aroma plays a major role in determining wine quality and economic value. In many grape varieties cultivated in BC, the aroma makeup is built in the vineyard where key aromatics accumulate in the grapes. Irrigation and crop size adjustments are two main strategies that growers have adopted to manage fruit ripening and composition. Both strategies have been largely used as a tool to improve the composition of red grapes but very limited information is available on the impact of these strategies on the accumulation of aromatics in white grapes. This project aims to evaluate the effect of deficit irrigation and crop size adjustment strategies on the concentration of aromatics in white grapes and wines. The goal is to develop an irrigation and crop size adjustment strategy that maximizes the level of aromatics produced in white grapes cultivated in BC while minimizing water demands."
Effects of ultraviolet-B radiarion on ecophysiology of weedy species,"Chlorofluorocarbons and other O3 antagonists have been suggested to increase terrestrial ultraviolet B (UV-B; 290 to 320 nm) levels by thinning the stratospheric O3 layer. This radiation reduces plant growth and alters plant morphology and biomass partitioning. Intra- and interspecific interactions are important in determining the structure and dynamics of plant communities. The competitive balance among species in populations is influenced by the entire environmental complex. Even subtle differences in response to this radiation at the seedling stage can be pivotal to altering the competitive interactions among species. The research proposed in this application focuses on effects of UV-B radiation on weed and crop seedlings in an agroecological context, emphasizing their intra- and interspecific interactions, as well as their interactions with biotic (e.g. insects) and abiotic (e.g. moisture stress) environments. The specific objectives are to determine: (1) if soil moisture stress and UV-B radiation interact in influencing intra- and interspecific competitive interactions in weed-crop mixtures, and to investigate the morphological underpinnings of these interactions, (2) if exposure of seedlings of broccoli and its common weeds to UV-B radiation influences growth, development, and feeding and/or egg-laying preferences of Trichloplusia ni (cabbage looper), and whether T. ni preference changes with the age of the UV-B exposed plants, (3) if the UV-B radiation influences water-use-efficiency of seedlings of broccoli and its commonly associated weeds (C. album and C. bursa-pastoris), and the role of leaf surface characteristics in this influence, (4) if the influence of UV-B radiation on leaf surface characteristics affects the efficacy of foliar-applied chemicals by affecting leaf retention characteristics, and (5) if the UV-B level during seed development influences C. officinale seed germination behaviour, which in turn influences its soil-borne seed bank dynamics, and if a reduction in vegetative growth by UV-B stress influences the fecundity of this weed."
Weaning distress in dairy calves,"The welfare of animals, especially those used in food production, has become an area of increasing social concern. A research priority cited repeatedly by agricultural and other animal-user groups is the development of methodology for a more objective assessment of animal well-being. My proposal involves developing methods for the scientific study of animal welfare, and applying these methods to socially and economically important issues in the care of farm animals. This project will be the first comprehensive research on weaning distress in the dairy calf. In calves, as in other mammalian species, weaning is characterized by abnormally high levels of activity, distress vocalizations, decreased food intake, poor growth, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Weaning normally involves both a change from milk to solid-based diet and separation from the mother. Dairy calves, however, are separated from the cow within the first day of life and weaned from milk to solid food weeks later. Thus this system provides an ideal model for understanding factors affecting weaning distress independent of separation from the dam. The research will provide basic insights into such issues as the regulation of injestive behaviour, and the importance of nutritional, social and developmental factors in affecting weaning stress. The work will also provide a basis for applied research of practical relevance to dairy producers, in developing rearing methods that provide improvements to both the calf and to the productivity of the farm. The funds will go toward training of young scientists to help meet a growing demand for academics, veterinarians and other professionals with expertise in animal welfare research."
The vulnerable transition cow: coping with illness,"This research will provide new insights into the behavioural changes in animals associated with the onset of disease. The dairy cow provides an excellent system for studying these changes because many cows become ill, and much of this illness is concentrated in a period of a few weeks around the time of calving. These ‘sickness behaviours’ have been studied in humans and laboratory animals, but very little work has been done on farm animals. Previous work in my laboratory has provided some of the first data showing that certain behaviours, such as reduced feeding and social interactions, can identify cows at risk for disease after calving. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop a more fundamental understanding of the relationship between behaviour and health in dairy cows. Specifically, I propose a series of experiments designed to I) identifying the range of sickness behaviours performed by dairy cows, discriminating between those behavior that provide both short- and long-term benefit to the cow, and 2) identifying aspects of a cow's social environment, including her particular coping strategy to a stressful environment, that might increase her susceptibility to disease. The appropriate use and treatment of animals are among the most important challenges facing animal agriculture today, and the high rate of illness at the time of calving is also of great concern."
Molecular characterization of Salmonella enterica in food supply systems,"Salmonella is the leading cause of foodborne deaths in Canada and worldwide. Salmonella outbreaks have been associated with not only foods of animal origins, but also fresh produce and tree nuts. My long term goal is to develop integrative approaches to investigate the fundamental issues associated with Salmonella contamination on a ""farm-to-fork"" basis, with the aid of genomics approaches and big data-driven analysis. There are three focus areas (FAs) in my research proposal: (FA1) Use geospatial algorithms to predict the prevalence and persistence of Salmonella in food-production environment in British Columbia; (FA2) Identify and characterize genetic factors modulating Salmonella survival in food supply systems; (FA3) Evaluate the performance of novel antimicrobials in reducing Salmonella contaminations in food supply systems. The suite of projects described in my proposal comprises a unique, synergistic approach to generate knowledge that will foster new ideas for mitigation strategies aiming at reducing Salmonella infections. The results of our research will be communicated in a readily understandable form such as the production of food safety publications, and be accessible to stakeholders including public and private sectors as well as Canadian consumers."
Ecophysiology of weedy species,"The use of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone antagonists has been suggested to increase terrestrial UV-B radiation (290-320 nm) by thinning the stratospheric ozone layer. We have shown that weedy species differ in their response to UV-B radiation and that this radiation significantly influences interaction of weeds with associated crops, weedy neighbours, and other components of their biotic environment. I intend to continue this line of research and explore some new but related areas to advance our holistic understanding of weed ecophysiology in an agroecological context. 

The research proposed in this application will attempt to determine if: (I) UV-B radiation modifies the size hierarchy of the agricultural weed Chenopodium album (lambsquarters ), (2) UV-B level during seed development influences Cynoglossurn officinale (hound's-tongue) seed germination behaviour, which may influence its seed bank dynamics, (3) UV-B radiation influences the allelopathic influence of Sisymbrium altissimum (tall hedge mustard) on its biotic associates, (4) UV-B radiation influences mycorrhizal colonization in selected rangeland weeds, and this varies among UV-B susceptible and tolerant species indicated by their growth and morphological response, (5) UV-B radiation influences carbon transfer between C. officinale and its associated grasses, and if plant developmental stage and species-specific damage by selective herbicide or clipping alters the source-sink relationship that regulates carbon transfer via mycorrhizal connections. 

This research will improve our understanding of the effect of UV-B radiation on size hierarchy and reproductive success of weedy species and of the roles of allelopathy and arbascular mycorrhizae in the interaction of weeds with their biotic environment. In addition to answering significant biological questions, the research will also provide information that could be useful in developing improved weed management strategies.
"
Response of verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli to environmental stresses in food supply systems,"Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) are foodborne microorganisms capable of causing bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and deaths; thus they represent a serious public health concern. Although 0157:H7 is the best known and studied VTEC serotype, there is growing concern over the emergence of more than 200 highly virulent non-0157 STEC serotypes, several of which are associated with foodborne outbreaks and/or severe human illness. Understanding how VTEC adapt to foods and food processing procedures is a key to prevent VTEC transmission throughout the food supply chain. However, VTEC are an extremely heterogeneous group of organisms that vary significantly in prevalence and persistence in many foods and food processing environments. There is currently limited information on the genetic basis of the ability of VTEC to respond to a number of distinct environmental stresses. The overall goal of my research program will be to better understand how VTEC respond to specific, defined stresses present in foods and also food processing environments. I hypothesize that a fundamental understanding of the biology of these bacteria can lead to targeted mitigation strategies. My five-year research program aims to identify important genetic factors that contribute to VTEC survival during the exposure to (i) stresses commonly associated with food processing (i.e., sanitation, antimicrobial treatment and heat treatment) and (ii) storage in major food vehicles that are commonly associated with VTEC infections (i.e., fresh produce and ground beef). I will test a diversified panel of VTEC strains isolated from the environment, sporadic illness, and outbreak isolates in Canada and the USA for both survival and growth potential in foods and in response to food- processing procedures. Furthermore, I, along with trained HQP will use transcriptomics (qPCR and RNASeq) and mutagenesis (transposon mutagenesis and targeted gene deletion) approaches to identify and characterize the genetic factors that VTEC rely on to respond to the environmental stresses. These studies will address fundamental questions of stress response and .environmental adaptation of VTEC which should provide new knowledge on how VTEC survive in foods and associated food processing environments. As more than two-thirds of the VTEC strains I investigate were isolated in Canada, my research will provide unique insights into the VTEC related food safety issues present in Canada. Overall, the results from my research program will serve as an important step towards the development of surveillance and mitigation strategies for VTEC associated foodborne diseases. Training of HQP will be another important outcome of my research program."

Elucidating soil carbon dynamics for climate change adaptation and mitigation tradeoff analysis at a landscape scale,"A key strategy to improve the resiliency of agricultural production and also reduce the impact of agriculture on climate change (i.e. adaptation and mitigation) is the adoption of beneficial management practices (BMPs) that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, the magnitude of this potential is unclear and recent work indicates SOC losses due to increasing temperatures may be higher than previously expected. To resolve this uncertainty a number of questions need to be addressed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the field scale, questions remain about the dynamics of SOC in relation to various environmental (e.g. temperature, precipitation) and management factors (e.g. tillage, land use change). Factors affecting rates of SOC loss are poorly understood as is the rate that SOC can be regained or at what concentration gains will level off. At the landscape scale it is unclear how effectively process-models predict long-term changes in SOC given BMP configurations and land-use change and whether new modeling approaches can improve the accuracy of simulations. 

The overarching long-term goal of my research program is to develop strategies that simultaneously maximize SOC retention within agricultural landscapes while minimizing GHG emissions. Our short-term program is focused primarily on understanding the mechanisms that control SOC dynamics and improving process models to test hypotheses at the landscape scale. Our Research Portal approach entails scaling plot level analyses to the landscape and projecting outcomes over time using geographical information systems, remote sensing and ecosystem process models. The overarching objective of our five-year research program will address the following question: Does the rate, quantity and duration of SOC sequestration under perennial vegetation BMPs enable the optimization for both agricultural climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives at the landscape scale. 

My lab’s five year research program has three specific objectives: 
(1.) Quantify the rate, amount and duration of SOC sequestration and losses for BMPs and land use change; 
(2.) Elucidate the mechanisms that control SOC dynamics for these land management options; and 
(3.) Parameterize, validate and model BMPs and land use change options at the landscape scale given expected climate projections to test for adaption and mitigation synergies.

My research program will increase the understanding of the mechanisms that control SOC sequestration to develop regionally appropriate models and help improve global ones. This research will greatly enhance Canadian and global efforts to meet commitments to mitigate climate change while at the same time improve the capacity to produce food.

Functional characterization of genes required for yeast fitness during fermentation,"The unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is a model organism for understanding conserved cellular processes and is also a key microorganism for industrial food production. The modem S. cerevisiae genome has evolved to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of wine fermentation. However, most studies of S. cerevisiae gene function are performed in relatively benign laboratory conditions and as a result, 15% of yeast genes still have no known function. The changes to cellular metabolism that enable survival of yeast during fermentation are also poorly understood. My lab has assessed the growth of all nonessential S. cerevisiae genes during grape juice fermentation. We have discovered that autophagy (literally, ""self-eating""), a process whereby cells engulf their own cytoplasm and recycle unwanted organelles for reuse of essential nutrients, is important for cellular fitness during fermentation. A number of other genes either positively or negatively affect cell survival under fermentation conditions, including over fifty genes with no previously known cellular function. This study provides a framework for understanding how yeast are adapted to fermentation and suggests possible means to improve the ability of commercial yeast strains to withstand the fermentation process. My NSERC Discovery Grant proposes to understand the mechanistic details of how autophagy is induced during fermentation and to provide a function for uncharacterized genes that have altered fitness during fermentation. Future implications of this proposal include developing stress resistant wine yeast strains with improved fermentation capability. Understanding stress resistance pathways in yeast creates potential to increase stress resistance in wine yeast, improve industrial performance and reduce the cost to Canadian wineries of incomplete (sluggish or stuck) fermentations."
"Improving on-farm drainage management to reduce the impacts of climate change in Delta, BC","Delta, British Columbia is one of the province's most productive agricultural regions but faces critical challenges from a changing climate. Precipitation patterns are expected to continue to shift, impeding agriculture producers' ability to manage their fields by reducing the number of ""workable"" days. This shift in precipitation pattern may also increase flooding and risk of catastrophic crop loss. Increased salinization of highly productive soils in Delta is also a concern. This project will address these issues through the following objectives: 1. Demonstrate and evaluate new on-farm strategies for addressing drainage and salinity problems; 2. Improve producer understanding of existing drainage and salinity management options; and 3. Increase producer access drainage and salinity management information and tools and promote promising strategies. This project is a collaborative effort among the University of British Columbia, the Delta Farmers Institute, the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust, and numerous producers in Delta."
Determination of the essential nutrient profile of flaxseed cooking oil,"Flaxseed oil is well known for its high content of a-linolenic acid and phenolic compounds such as lignans. The conventional flaxseed oil is only used on salad dressings and unsuitable for frying foods due to its low smoke point. By improving the extraction techniques using a cold-pressing/filtering system, a high quality of flaxseed oil with a high smoke point is recently achieved. However, the characterization of the essential nutrient profile of this type of flaxseed cooking oil is still limited. The objectives of this collaboration between UBC Food Science Program and a flaxseed oil company located in Richmond, BG Health Group Inc. are as follows: 1) to determine the fatty acid composition of flaxseed oil using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); 2) to determine the content of lignan in flaxseed oil using high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis, 3) to determine the content of tocopherol in flaxseed oil using HPLC analysis. Flaxseed cooking oil and several representative vegetable cooking oils will be used for the study of these nutrient profiles. With an optimized and standardized sample preparation protocol, chromatographic-based analysis is expected to accurately quantify the contents of fatty acids, lignan, and tocopherol in flaxseed cooking oil. The difference in the essential nutrient profile between flaxseed cooking oil and other commercial vegetable cooking oils will be compared as well. In sum, this study is positioned to benefit the flaxseed oil manufacture industry in Canada by developing a standardized chromatographic-based protocol to determine the essential nutrient profile of flaxseed cooking oil."

Characterizing phytochemical content of bioactive coffee leaf materials for use in coffee tea leaf beverages,"The project is designed to better understand the chemical and bioactive potential that is offered by coffee leaf; to standardize the composition (chemical components and related bioactivity) which will be used for quality standards of the commodity. Specifically, we will endeavor two objectives. 1) to characterize the phytochemical content (e.g. chlorogenic acids, mangiferin and isomangiferin) and related antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, both before and after processing (e.g. forms of powders, extracts and supplement); 2) To determine the release of phytochemical bioactives with infusion of boiling water over time (e.g. 0-20 minutes); characteristic to temperature, (e.g. 35°, 50°, 75°, 85° and 100° C), to simulate tea brewing. These research activities will yield outcomes that should enable the company to support claims for quality (taste) and bioactivity (antioxidant/anti-inflammatory). These activities could also translate into potential intellectual property for standardized phytochemical compositions with known bioactivity."
UBC Unrestricted Research Funds,"My research program is focused on working with farmers, and other land managers of agricultural landscapes to find ways to better monitor, protect and enhance biodiversity and the availability of ecosystem services including food, fiber, fuel and timber production, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water quality and quantity regulation. My research has been concentrated on assessing the impact of farm management practices on plant biomass and biodiversity, soil physical and chemical properties, nutrients in water storm and irrigation runoff, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N20) emissions. I am interested in developing methods to translate these measures of ecosystem function into estimates of the availability of ecosystem services. Then to bridge results from plot and farm level to those at larger scales, at the watershed, landscape and region using remote sensing and geographical information system tools. By providing landscape level assessments I see the possibility for farmers to not only better understand wider implications of their management practices but also to provide decision makers tools to address the increasing need for agricultural landscape to meet multiple societal objectives beyond just food production."
Structure function and food related proteins,"The long-term goal of our NSERC-funded research program has been to understand the fundamental processes that explain how protein functionality is dictated by protein structure. In food systems, proteins (including enzymes) have prominent roles in texture, flavour, odour, nutrition and prophylaxis in food safety/plant pathology (e.g., antimicrobial and plant defense proteins) as well as being processing aids (e.g., chymosin coagulates milk in cheese production). The research focus of this proposal is on a group of enzymes called aspartic proteases which share highly similar structures and modes of action, that are best represented by the stomach enzyme pepsin. Despite this uniformity, A wide wide spectrum of different functions exist making them an ideal model to study how protein structure determines function. Building on previous research by our group and others, the proposed research program addresses fundamental knowledge gaps in two overarching areas: 1) Food spoilage-related bioactive protein segments of aspartic proteases in plants; and 2) The underpinnings of aspartic protease structure tolerance to heat and alkalinity, and selectivity for particular targets. For the first research area, aspartic proteases from plants have an extra portion compared to those from non-plant sources called the plant-specific insert (PSI). The PSI is critical for plant aspartic proteases to interact with membranes, including activity against plant pathogens as part of plants’ immune responses to invading fungi. The structure and specific points of contact with membranes will be solved at the highest level of detail in order to better understand the mode of action of the PSI. The second research area will entail solving the structures of a little-studied malarial aspartic protease (plasmepsin V) complexed with well-known inhibitors to narrow the possible range of binding sites so as to direct computer-aided inhibitor design specific to plasmepsin V. Three studies will contribute to understanding how highly unusual aspartic proteases are able to work at extreme temperature (thermopsin from an organism in acidic hot springs) and non-acidic pH (renin from human kidney). Thermopsin and renin will serve as templates for engineering pepsin (which is not temperature- or neutral pH-stable) by providing a means of testing the stabilizing effects of key structural features. The impact of the proposed research program will be to improve knowledge regarding AP structures and functions thereby enabling novel strategies for interventions in food-related challenges such as plant diseases and enzyme biotechnological applications."
Characterizing microflora composition during the spontaneous fermentation of cassava flour,"Quejos Ancient Foods (QAF) Inc. manufactures a line of dough-based food products that are gluten- and yeast-free. The dough is made from cassava flour, which is extracted from the roots of cassava plants. Traditionally, the cassava flour undergoes fermentation without the addition of yeast before the dough is made, and this process is not strictly regulated. In order to develop a standardized fermentation procedure for the production of a consistently high-quality product, effective monitoring and controlling of the indigenous microflora is therefore necessary. We expect to generate critical information for the development of science-based quality control in the production of fermented cassava flour-based products by QAF. Specific objectives include: (1) to study the diversity and dynamics of the indigenous microflora during the fermentation of cassava flour; (2) to evaluate the quality of cassava flour at different stages of fermentation, and (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of biomarkers in assessing the quality of fermented cassava flour."
"New approaches to welfare assessment in dairy calves: effects of social housing on cognition, cognitive bias and anticipatory behaviour","The welfare of farm animals has become an area of increasing concern. A research priority cited by animal-user groups is the development of more objective methods of assessment of animal welfare. My proposal addresses this priority by developing new methods for welfare assessment. One recent conceptual innovation has been to use changes in cognitive functioning to assess affective states. Borrowing on experimental approaches designed to assess depression in humans, recently modified for use in animals, my research will test the effects of changes in affective states (such as those associated with social separation) on how dairy calves respond to ambiguous stimuli. Arguably equally important, and more practical to assess, are changes in anticipatory behaviours that may also be used to assess subjective states, so I propose a parallel series of experiments testing the effects of social separation on anticipatory behaviour. The social separation model is particularly relevant for dairy calves, as these animals are typically housed in individual pens or hutches. A growing body of literature on rats suggests that rearing animals with this level of social isolation can result in cognitive deficits, characterized by problems in memory and learning tasks. I propose a series of tests assessing the effects of social and individual housing on measures of cognition in dairy calves; these will be the first ever tests of the effects social isolation on cognition in farm animals. Thus the proposed experiments will contribute to the basic literature on the effects of social experience on learning, and use measures from learning experiments to assess changes in welfare associated with social isolation. My research will use robotic calf feeders to train calves in learning tasks; these feeders are becoming common on dairy farms, increasing the potential for future application of my findings on commercial farms. The funding will be largely devoted towards the training of scientists, helping to meet a growing demand for academics and professionals with expertise in animal welfare."
NSERC/SPCA-BCVMA-Animal Industries Senior Industrial Research Chair in Animal Welfare (research),"Since the 1960's, the welfare of animals, especially those used in food production and biomedical research, has become an area of increasing social concern. The UBC Animal Welfare Program is an active group of approximately 30 researchers working to improve the lives of farm, laboratory and companion animals. This proposal provides core funding for this group for the next five years. We propose new work in four areas. I) Farm animal work will focus especially on dairy cattle, including a comprehensive study of the development of hoof lesions early in the cow's first lactation for the purpose of assessing how lesions affect gait, and how housing, management and cow behaviour contribute to lesions. 2) Laboratory animal work will include research on housing that better meets the animals' needs, combined with an evaluation of the humaneness of different methods of euthanasia. 3) Companion animal work will focus especially on aggressive dogs by surveying various breeds for temperament differences predictive of aggression, and identifying how aggression varies according to the dog's age, gender, neutering, and the dog-owner relationship. 4) Research on social consensus on animal care will focus on understand public values regarding animals, beginning with views about the types and level of care that pet owners should provide and which obligations should be enshrined in public policy. The proposed work will also contribute to the emerging field of animal welfare science, especially through developing and testing new methods for researching the welfare of animals. Methodological advances are expected in the use of behaviours as indicators of pain and distress, in the application of the Marginal Value Theorem in assessing how animals value different design features in their environment, and a novel integration of anthropological and biological data as a basis for animal-related social policy."

A return to simple and historically successful micronutrient interventions: Thiamin-fortified fish sauce combats ‘hidden hunger’ in rural Cambodia,"Food fortification, or adding vitamins and minerals to commonly consumed foods, has been successfully employed in Canada since the mid-twentieth century. Salt iodization, the addition of vitamins A and D to milk, and B vitamin fortification of white flour have nearly eradiated micronutrient deficiency diseases in Canada and throughout the economically developed world. However, the lessons learned from this simple, cost-effective, sustainable, and ‘passive’ intervention have not transcended borders for widespread use in all developing regions. In Cambodia, only iodine (salt) fortification is mandatory, and although smaller scale iron (fish and soy sauce) and vitamin A (vegetable oil) fortification programs are being piloted, morbidity and mortality caused by micronutrient deficiencies continues to plague vulnerable groups, including young children and childbearing women. 

Thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency remains an often-overlooked public health issue in Cambodia, causing an estimated 500 infants deaths annually. Women with poor dietary thiamin intake produce breast milk with a low thiamin content, putting their exclusively breastfed infants at a high risk of developing infantile beriberi. After identifying widespread poor thiamin status among a representative group of women of childbearing age in rural Prey Veng province, Cambodia, we looked to historical solutions to tackle this issue, and developed thiamin-fortified fish sauce. Extensive product development research confirmed that thiamin stability for at least one year in this popular Cambodian condiment, and sensory evaluation revealed that thiamin does not affect the taste, smell, or texture of fish sauce. Women and their families consumed the study fish sauce as they normally would over six months in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Thiamin status improved among women and their children, as well as among a subgroup of pregnant and lactating women consuming fortified fish sauce compared to an identical control (placebo) fish sauce. While no public health intervention can truly reach everyone, high fish sauce consumption compliance highlights the potential of fish sauce as an ideal fortification vehicle in Cambodia beyond a controlled study environment. In collaboration with the Cambodian Ministries of Planning and Health, we hope to scale up fish sauce fortification to combat thiamin deficiency throughout Cambodia. We also plan to explore other vitamins not typically present in fortification programs (eg. riboflavin) to combat multiple micronutrient deficiencies with one intervention.

Looking to past successes to tackle population-wide micronutrient deficiencies, fortification is an ideal public health nutrition intervention in Cambodia and potentially other regions with a high burden of hidden hunger."
Development of humane wildlife control accreditation program,"British Columbia is known internationally for its diverse wildlife and landscapes, but human-wildlife conflict often arises over concerns for disease transmission, public and pet safety, and nuisance activities. World-wide, vertebrate pest control - the active removal of undesirable wild animals - is one of the major causes of intentional killing by humans. The potential for animal suffering is high, but there are no established scientific criteria or consensus on what methods should be regarded as humane for use in Canada. Further, minimum legal standards vary by jurisdiction and there is typically little enforcement to ensure that humane methods are used. One consequence is frequent conflict between the animal protection movement and others including conservationists. An international collaboration will be formed to establish criteria, scientific evidence, and expert opinion leading to science-based guidelines on humane pest control, initially to create an accreditation program in BC, but with a view to providing global leadership."
Ecophysiology of weedy species,"The use of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone antagonists has been suggested to increase terrestrial UV-B radiation (290-320 nm) by thinning the stratospheric ozone layer. We have shown that weedy species differ in their response to UV-B radiation and that this radiation significantly influences interaction of weeds with associated crops, weedy neighbours, and other components of their biotic environment. I intend to continue this line of research and explore some new but related areas to advance our holistic understanding of weed ecophysiology in an agroecological context. 

The research proposed in this application will attempt to determine if: (I) UV-B radiation modifies the size hierarchy of the agricultural weed Chenopodium album (lambsquarters), (2) UV-B level during seed development influences Cynoglossum officinale (hound's-tongue) seed germination behaviour, which may influence its seed bank dynamics, (3) UV-B radiation influences the allelopathic influence of Sisymbrium altissimum (tall hedge mustard) on its biotic associates, (4) UV-B radiation influences mycorrhizal colonization in selected rangeland weeds, and this varies among UV-B susceptible and tolerant species indicated by their growth and morphological response, (5) UV-B radiation influences carbon transfer between C. officinale and its associated grasses, and if plant developmental stage and species-specific damage by selective herbicide or clipping alters the source-sink relationship that regulates carbon transfer via mycorrhizal connections. 

This research will improve our understanding of the effect of UV-B radiation on size hierarchy and reproductive success of weedy species and of the roles of allelopathy and arbascular mycorrhizae in the interaction of weeds with their biotic environment. In addition to answering significant biological questions, the research will also provide information that could be useful in developing improved weed management strategies.

Examining school day dietary practices: An analysis of national dietary data from the 2004 and 2015 Canadian Community Health Surveys,"Ensuring that children have access to healthy food to grow, learn and thrive is a critical challenge in Canada, since few Canadian children meet Canada's Food Guide's recommendations for healthy eating. Children report even lower dietary quality as they grow into teenagers, and face additional barriers to a healthy diet if they grow up in households with insufficient financial means to access nutritious food. Schools have the potential to make a difference since most Canadian students eat one or more meals at school on weekdays and can improve access to nutritious foods via school meal programs, and nurture healthy habits through nutrition education programs and supportive school food environments. Since 2004, all 10 Canadian provinces have created policies about what types of foods schools should offer but some advocates think schools should be doing more to support health by improving access to healthy meals, milk programs and further reducing access to 'junk' foods. Yet little is known about what Canadian children eat during school hours or how children's dietary quality at school has changed over the last decade as new policies and programs have been implemented. In 2015, Statistics Canada carried out a nation-wide survey of what Canadians eat, making it the first survey of national dietary habits since 2004 and only the second national nutrition survey since the 1970s. This study will take advantage of this valuable opportunity to combine information from these two national nutrition surveys to answer important questions about what children eat during schools hours, how diets have changed over time and whether different cities and provinces have fared better when it comes to what children eat. We will also study what children drink at school, whether drinking milk during school-hours helps children meet their needs for important nutrients, and what role eating at fast food restaurants plays in the diets of Canadian students. This study is important for informing national policy debates about how best to improve the diets of Canadian children and for understanding how schools might make an impact on children's health."
Moving towards a more socially sustainable dairy system: public attitudes to dairy system in Brazil ,"Animal welfare is a field of animal science that focuses on evaluating and bettering animal lives by investigating biological functioning, affective states, and ability to live naturally. Animal welfare is a measure that is emerging as a key social concern in animal agriculture and as a result, is becoming more prevalent in industry practices. Nonetheless, there is a significant disconnect between public expectations of animal welfare in dairy farming and actual practices that are occurring. If consumers continue to hold animal welfare in high esteem in dairy production and if the Brazilian dairy industry doesn't change their practices to meet consumer expectations, the dairy industry may be regarded negatively by the public. To avoid such reaction, the Brazilian dairy industry should engage in discussion with the public to initiate a clear path towards establishing methods of care that correspond with public desires. The proposed project aims to facilitate discussion among consumers and producers in a virtual ""town hall"" meeting, allowing for opinions on hot topics in dairy industry to be voiced and for discussion to be had. This project will use discussion to provide farmers and the industry a better basis for making informed decisions about management on farms and policy for the Brazilian dairy industry."
Ecological and evolutionary constraints of plant tolerance to herbivory,"Some plants can tolerate herbivory and tissue damage without reductions in fitness (or yield), yet we know very little about the evolution and ecology of tolerance traits, or even the mechanisms involved in plant compensatory ability. Moreover, we still lack a basic understanding of whether the two components of plant defense against herbivores – resistance (avoiding being eaten) and tolerance (enduring being eaten) – differ in their ecological and evolutionary relationships to plant growth and reproduction. This is despite the fact that the expression and fixation of tolerance responses within plant populations may have immense ecological consequences, e.g. through decreasing the effectiveness of biocontrol agents for invasive weeds, or supporting a more diverse insect community in crops. Indeed, theory suggests that tolerance of herbivory may fundamentally differ from plant resistance in its effects on the population dynamics of insect herbivores and their natural enemies, e.g by avoiding the evolutionary arms race typical in plant-insect resistance evolution. A greater understanding of plant tolerance traits and impact could not only resolve some of the outstanding ecological and evolutionary questions around variation in plant defense and specificity in plant-insect interactions, but also produce an actionable target for plant improvement and protection programs.

My proposed research program's long-term objective is to provide a mechanistic and genetic framework to understand the ecology and evolution of plant tolerance of herbivory. To achieve this, HQP in my lab and I will use field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments to: 1) Identify biochemical and physiological mechanisms of tolerance; 2) Explore genetic markers for tolerance traits; 2) Determine ecological impacts of tolerance on key biotic interactions; and 3) Compare the evolution of tolerance in plant populations that have experienced ecological and evolutionary divergence. In particular, the comparison of traits among populations that span a gradient of plant-insect interactions (e.g. domesticated crops and their wild relatives), will be a powerful approach to understand the relationships among plant traits and insect population dynamics across ecological and evolutionary time scales. 

There is transformative potential for incorporating the genetic and biochemical mechanisms of plant tolerance to herbivory in plant breeding and crop production. Plant tolerance could have a large impact on plant yields despite high insect loads, and could slow and disrupt the evolution of pest resistance, which underscores the urgency of this research. Indeed, as tolerance responses in plants are likely related to a multitude of stress responses, including to drought, temperature and herbicide application, the products of this research program will be applicable to other plant improvements beyond pest management.

Identification of the key regulatory elements of fruit ripening in grapevine (vitis vinifera L.),"In Canada, the grape and wine industry has grown significantly in the past few decades, gaining both domestic and international recognition. The economic value of grapes is strongly related to fruit quality, which is determined by a plethora of compounds that accumulate during fruit ripening. Ripening represents a summation of processes that include molecular, chemical and physical changes. These processes are finely regulated by climatic conditions. 

The goal of my research program is to identify the underlying biological mechanisms (key genes and metabolites) that trigger and regulate ripening in the fruit tissues, as well as the molecular pathways that transduce environmental signals within the plant and modulate cell metabolism and fruit quality. 

My team of students and I will evaluate field and culture treatments to understand which solutes (i.e. sugars, ABA) originating from the plant or synthesized in the berry itself are necessary to induce the major ripening processes (fruit softening, accumulation of pigments and volatile organic compounds) that determine fruit quality. The molecular pathways affected by these treatments will be identified and isolated in order to identify key genes involved in the signaling pathway. The effect of environmental factors such as temperature and light in regulating the level of sugars, ABA and the key signaling genes will be investigated through open field and greenhouse experiments where these factors will be manipulated, and the fruit response will be evaluated at the gene expression and metabolite level.

This program will combine robust field and laboratory experiments with a systems-level characte1ization of developing fruit, also utilizing advanced platforms for transcriptome (RNA-seq) and metabolite (GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC) analyses. The knowledge generated, integrated with subsequent applied experiments, will benefit grape growers in BC, Ontario and other parts of Canada by developing new practices for improving fruit ripening and optimizing fruit quality in vineyards. 

Finally, the program will provide an excellent training platform in viticulture for M.Sc., Ph.D. and undergraduate students. These HQP will learn and profit from the multidisciplinary nature of this program, which will provide training opportunities to develop research skills in plant biology and genomics, while also advancing knowledge in the field of applied physiology.

These studies represent assessment of bioactivity and physiological activity in a number of model systems. The project titled above will focus on constructing the final reports for these research activities. Consolation by the applicant with statisticians, web designers and editorial services will be used to complete the reports."
Molecular and Physiological Regulation of Fruit Ripening and Compostion in Grapevine,"The Canadian grape and wine industry has evolved into a strong niche market producing internationally-respected wines, specifically in British Columbia, where the number of wineries and the income they generate have grown steadily in the last 20 years.

The economic value of grapes is strongly related to fruit composition, which is determined by a plethora of compounds that accumulate during fruit ripening. The establishment of a platform for investigating the grape berry metabolism will be critical for understanding the molecular and physiological regulation of fruit ripening and composition. The knowledge generated will be crucial for revealing the molecular and physiological basis of plant-environment interactions and how they determine fruit quality. These outcomes will greatly benefit viticulturists in their struggle to improve fruit quality in vineyards.

The project will address both fundamental and applied aspects of viticulture and will adopt an interdisciplinary approach based on both traditional and innovative designs for resolving the biological complexity underlying fruit ripening and quality. This knowledge will benefit the development of new viticultural practices for optimizing fruit quality in the vineyard, also resulting in a much stronger potential for higher quality and more valuable wine. Overall the project will contribute to the growth of the grape and wine industry of British Columbia and Canada by providing new knowledge for improved grape production.

"Inflammation, stress and the conceptus-endometrium cross communication in dairy cows","The decrease in fertility of the lactating dairy cow is multi-factorial and associated with high milk production (Lucy, 2001). Milk production has been associated with physiological changes that can reduce fertility such as accentuated negative energy balance (Wathes et al., 2007), lower concentrations of progesterone and estradiol in plasma (Wiltbank et al., 2006), and disruption of the growth hormone/insulin-growth factor-I axis in the liver early postpartum (Kobayashi et al., 1999). Lactating dairy cows have high fertilization rate of 80 to 90% but only around 35% remain pregnant after 60 days of gestation (Santos et al., 2004; Sartori et al., 2010). The basic mechanisms that lead to this substantial embryonic and fetal loss is not clearly understood at the molecular and cellular levels, particularly in the cross talk between the conceptus and the endometrium. More specifically, I aim to understand the roles of chronic stress and inflammation (i.e. negative energy balance, sub-clinical endometritis, mastitis and lameness) on pregnancy maintenance and related gene and protein expression in the endometrium and conceptus. Some work has addressed mechanisms associated with the generation of a successful pregnancy in ruminants, but little is known about the cellular and molecular changes associated with failure of early and late embryonic development. A recent study of my own (Cerri et al., 2012) demonstrated that novel genes in the endometrium are differentially regulated by lactation in cows maintained under similar metabolic conditions. The results of this and other work suggest that homeorhetic changes associated with initiation of milk production, postpartum diseases, and stress due to management practices affects specific genes and pathways in the endometrium and conceptus. This program will help unveil new mechanisms associated with infertility in lactating dairy cows and propose innovative interventions to circumvent this problem by studying effects of chronic stress and inflammation on endometrium and conceptus gene and protein expression, as well as researching genetic markers tying health and pregnancy loss."
Assessing the welfare of growing dairy calves,"The objectives of this proposal are to answer the following broad questions: 1. Do variations between individual calves in the occurrence of locomotor play and social play reflect variations in welfare due to illness, low energy intakes and/or poor growth? 2. How can we best measure locomotor and social play behaviour to assess the welfare of dairy calves? 3. Can the age at which calves reach certain stages in behavioural development (e.g. replacement of locomotor play by social play, first estrous behaviours, ability to eat solid feeds) be used to assess the welfare of growing animals? Public concern about farm animal welfare has led to welfare standards for farm animals and automated monitoring of behaviour has potential to enable behavioural measures to be used in animal welfare assessments. Poor dairy calf welfare has long term impacts on the productive life of adult cow, so it is important to have good methods to assess their welfare. Most measures used in welfare assessment identify poor welfare, but there is increased interest in using measures of good welfare. Among growing animals, play behaviour has been proposed as a good candidate for a positive welfare indicator. Dairy calves show a variety of locomotor and social play but we need better evidence of the link between play and animal welfare. Most schemes for assessing the welfare of growing animals are based on their state at a particular age. However, it is likely that the welfare of growing animals may be better assessed in terms of how they are developing. This proposed research involves a series of experiments on group housed dairy calves fed by automated feeding systems, to validate the use of measures of social and locomotor play as potential behavioural-based indicators of the good welfare of dairy calves. The link between the timing of the occurrence of various play behaviours, of the ability to eat solid feed and of first estrous will show the extent that the general timing of behavioural development is inter-related and affected by feeding and weaning strategies. The link with the age of later reproductive development may help us understand the problem of delayed reproduction of cattle."
Investigation of heavy metal bioavailability and bioaccesibility in SierraSil® mineral complex and its impacts on inflammation and bioavailability of other medications and natural health products,"SierraSil® mineral products are used to relieve pain and soreness of joints and muscle by athletes or patients with osteoarthritis. This mineral clay is rich in essential and trace minerals, including potentially harmful elements such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. Therefore, we wish to evaluate the bioaccessibility of these heavy metals using different methods as well as the bioavailability of the minerals using an in vitro Caco-2 monolayer model. It is known that SierraSil® can inhibit joint inflammation, however, there is no current information on its effectiveness to inhibit intestinal inflammation; and furthermore if there are interactions with other medications that could result in adverse reactions. We will use an in vitro inflamed intestinal cell model to investigate the effects of SierraSil® on intestinal inflammation and use Caco-2 monolayer to investigate the effects of SierraSil® on the bioavailability of drugs and natural health products. We expect that only small amount of heavy metals contained in SierraSil® are bioaccessible and bioavailable and it will not significantly interact with other medications. Furthermore, this product can also be used to mitigate intestinal inflammation, an area that has not been heavily investigated before, but of considerable interest to the industry partner."
Characterization and intervention strategies of campylobacter jejuni biofilm in a microfluidic 'lab-on-a-chip' system,"Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world, with diarrhea often associated with consumption of undercooked poultry products, drinking water and unpasteurized milk. It is estimated that 1% of Canadian population is affected with campylobacteriosis each year, resulting in significant burden on economy because of lost productivity and the potential for serious medical complications. Residing in a biofilm microenvironment is a critical way for this microaerophilic pathogen to survive and transmit into the food chain in stressful conditions, such as the natural aerobic environment, leading to food poisoning. Biofilm formation allows bacteria to grow and survive, as the surface-attached and matrix-encased bacteria are protected. My overall research program is to understand the behavior of C. jejuni in the environment, food systems and animals, and to develop mitigation strategies to reduce campylobacteriosis. The aim of this research proposal is to use novel approach and advanced technology to characterize C. jejuni biofilms and develop intervention strategies. Our central hypothesis is that natural compounds and synthetic polymers can inhibit C. jejuni biofilm formation driven by environmental and genetic factors. Our specific objectives in the first five-year period are to investigate oxygen condition that promotes C. jejuni biofilm formation, to identify and characterize C. jejuni colonization associated proteins involved in biofilm formation, to identify compounds as either antimicrobials or quorum sensing (QS) signal inhibitors, resulting in less C. jejuni biofilms, and to develop molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as QS capturer to inhibit C. jejuni biofilms. We have established a microfluidic ""lab-on-a-chip"" platform coupled with biophysical instruments (i.e., confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy) to cultivate and nondestructively characterize C. jejuni biofilms in a natural state. The work will allow us to better understand biofilm as an important vehicle for C. jejuni to survive during transit between hosts and on food products under unfavorable conditions and to further develop effective strategies to reduce biofilm formation. The studies address fundamental questions of bacterial stress, QS, and gene expression, and the knowledge to be generated is therefore of broad biological interest. The development of QS inhibitors and capturers will suggest new ways that food industry to reduce the prevalence of pathogens. For example, MIPs can be grafted onto food contact surfaces to reduce bacterial biofilms. Pharmaceutical company may also be able to design novel antimicrobials based on new target site (i.e., QS) while do not increase bacterial antibiotic resistance. This research has the potential for significant economic benefit to Canadian food producers and public health while increasing fundamental knowledge on bacterial biofilms that may translate to study other pathogens."

Implementation of British Columbia's school nutrition guidelines in Vancouver public schools,"The number of overweight and obese children is on the rise around the world and in Canada. It is thought that, as Canadian children spend a large part of their lives in schools, availability of foods high in sugar, fat, and salt in schools has contributed to this epidemic.

To address this critical public health issue, a number of provinces have developed guidelines around what foods should and should not be available for children in public schools. British Columbia (BC) has released an updated set of guidelines to be fully in place in schools by the fall of 2014. Each school board and school has a significant amount of freedom to choose how they meet the nutritional guidelines.

This study will focus on 1) ways in which Vancouver public schools, each with their own unique setting, are meeting the guidelines, and 2) how parents, students and other key school staff perceive the new guidelines to gain a better understanding of ways schools can be supported to ensure availability of healthy foods for students. Specific cases of
Vancouver public schools and their progress towards meeting the nutritional guidelines will be examined. I will collect information from key people involved in the development of the guidelines, school administrators, decision-makers, school staff, parents, students, and through spending significant time at each school. The overall aim of this project is to provide insight for municipal and provincial decision-makers into what strategies to improve availability of healthy foods in schools will likely be successful. Only by determining what is working and the challenges schools face in adhering to the nutritional guidelines can this type of intervention serve its full potential and be effective both for children now and in their futures. This research will not only be informative for British Columbia but also for other provinces hoping to develop or improve their own nutritional guidelines.

Comparative and integrative cardiorespiratory physiology,"The cardiovascular system, as a critical life support system, plays a key role in how vertebrates tolerate or adapt to diverse ecological niches. My long-term research aim is to define underlying mechanisms and unifying concepts that explain cardiovascular diversity and phenotypic plasticity among lower vertebrates, and especially in fishes. A central question is: What cardiovascular features allow an animal to tolerate a particular environmental condition? The approach uses in vivo and in vitro (organ, tissue and cellular) intervention studies (emphasizing exercise, 02, pH, temperature and pharmacological agents), as well as species comparisons, and reveals much about the animal as a whole, more so if mechanisms setting the limits for maximum cardiac performance are understood. One research theme focuses on why fish stop swimming, especially at warm temperatures. Experiments will test the working hypothesis that 02 supply to the heart becomes limited during extreme exercise, causing fish to stop swimming. Experiments include innovative measurements of 02 in venous blood during swimming and assessments of maximum heart performance under conditions that simulate those occurring in venous blood near fatigue. A second research theme examines cardiovascular regulation when an animal has no 02 (anoxia). Experiments will test the working hypothesis that anoxic turtles switch from central (neural) to local (tissue-specific) cardiovascular controls as they tum down metabolism to pilot light status, whereas anoxic crucian carp maintain normal cardiac activity to avoid both acidosis and ethanol intoxication. The third research theme integrates mechanistic studies of ion trafficking in cardiac cells, seeking answers to how anoxic crucian carp hearts function normally, how anoxic turtles and common carp drastically reduce heart rate, how adrenaline may protect acidotic/hypoxic trout hearts, and why heart rate in fish rarely exceeds 120 bpm. A new emphasis on ion trafficking is important because our work, and that of others, is showing that the modulation of ion trafficking allows lower vertebrates alter cardiac excitability in response to the environmental challenges that they routinely face, and we study."
Understanding individual variability in behaviours associated with illness in animals,"Previous work on humans has illustrated that many of the behaviours shown by ill patients are part of a coordinated strategy to fight disease. The research described in this proposal focuses on adapting these concepts to farm animals. Dairy cattle are an excellent model to study sickness behaviours as they are housed in a highly managed environment and the prevalence of illness is high. My group’s work to date has shown variation among individuals in their behavioural responses to disease. The proposed research borrows from recent advances in the psychology literature on personality in animals (to characterize how individuals differ in response to static test situations), and literature from behavioural ecology on behavioural reaction norms (to characterized how individuals differ in their responses to a variety of exogenous and endogenous stressors related to real-life management of dairy cattle). This overall aim of this proposal is to describe and understand these individual characteristics in cattle. Understanding how individuals differ in their response to illness and other challenges will improving our ability to use these behaviours in identifying sick and at-risk individuals. Thus the specific objectives are: 1) to characterizes the personality dimensions in cattle, 2) to describe behavioural reaction norms for cattle, providing a structure for understanding how different individuals respond to environmental variability, and 3) to determine how an understanding of both personality and behavioural reaction norms can account for individual differences in behaviours expressed by ill cattle and cattle likely to become ill. This research program has the potential to have a profound impact on the care and management of dairy cows and calves; both of which suffer from high rates of illness despite decades of research to date. The findings will form the basis for future practical innovations in care and management of dairy cattle that are aimed at preventing and treating disease."
CFI Infrastructure Operating Fund,"Food safety is a global concern and has significant impact on both public health and economic stability. The

Identifying putative bioactive properties of maillard reaction products with definable health benefits,"The Maillard Reaction (MR) contributes to the well-known color, aroma- and taste-properties of processed foods. Carbonyl compounds derived from intermediate-stage products of the MR can also represent diet-derived precursors of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs); the latter of which are thought to potentially contribute to glycoxidative and nitroxidative stresses in vivo. Some studies (including my laboratory) have found strong antioxidant and potential anti-inflammatory activity of MR components in the gut, suggesting a positive role in gut health. Later stage MRPs (e.g. melanoidins) have important antioxidant activity in food systems, and when present in vivo are largely localized to the intestine and excreted. Our work has shown that the MR represents a realistic functional food component that can be derived in simple model systems or from more complex processed food products, such as coffee brews and baked products. The overall focus of this research program will be to continue our work on relating the physico-chemical properties of many Maillard reaction products (MRPs ), based on structural analysis of molecular characteristics, with putative ( e.g. antioxidant, prooxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity) activities that are germane to intestinal health. The research program and related projects will build on significant multidisciplinary scientific expertise and have both academic and industrial value. It is anticipated that up to 6 HQPs (3 graduate students and 3 undergraduate students) will be trained on projects that will contribute to defining a risk-benefit understanding of the ubiquitous presence of MRPs in foods."
The science of animal suffering,"Research on quality of life in humans illustrates that assessments of our own well-being are only partially related to what we have. Our sense of agency (how we gain access to the things we value, including our ability to learn about different outcomes and to make informed choices) is also critical. Recent reviews have revealed that agency may be important for the welfare of nonhuman animals. Pain is a key aspect of animal welfare, but until now the effect of agency on the experience of pain in animals has not been studied. My hypothesis is that agency critically affects how pain is experienced. My more provocative claim is that, in the absence of control and predictability, pain is more likely to be considered suffering, a distinction crucial in societal concerns about welfare. I propose a series of experiments with two main goals. The first is to test the prediction that animals will show lower responses to the identical pain stimulus, if tested in situations with i) knowledge of when and where the stimuli will be applied, including specific cues that make the stimuli predictable, and ii) the ability to control exposure (duration and magnitude) to the stimulus. Human patient reports of suffering are often accompanied by depression like states (low mood). I propose that pain in animals is of particular concern if it too causes or is associated with evidence of low mood. I also argue that animals in pain will show less evidence of low mood if living in environments that afford good predictability and control. The proposed studies will include both laboratory rats and dairy cattle, as both animals are subjected to a variety of routine, painful procedures, often under conditions of poor agency, providing a baseline for the proposed studies that can be compared with conditions that provide more information and control. The studies will use a suite of both novel and established measures of pain and mood states in these animals. The proposed experiments will contribute to the basic literature in animal welfare science and on affective states in animals, and may have important implications for our understanding of the welfare of animals kept in laboratory and agricultural systems. This research will provide insights into which procedures and practices are likely to accentuate pain responses, and increase the likelihood that pain is accompanied by low mood in animals. The development of a conceptual framework and methodology for the scientific assessment of suffering in animals will help inspire new research directed at harms experienced by animals under our care. The funds will go toward training of young scientists to help meet a growing demand for academics and professionals with expertise in animal welfare research."
Reducing Salmonella and Camplyobacter contamination of poultry,"Campylobacter and Salmonella species are the most common, culture-proven causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Poultry products are the major reservoir and are the most commonly implicated foods for both Campylobacter and Salmonella infections in humans. The contaminated chicken products cause a huge economic loss to poultry industry in Canada. The goal of this proposal is to reduce the load of both Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) in the digestive tract of chickens using different methods. Garlic-derived organosulfur compounds will be identified and the treatment to either chicken house or chickens with the microencapsulated sulfur compounds will reduce the numbers of broilers colonized with C. jejuni and Salmonella. Further, a de nova approach will be developed to identify lactobacilli with probiotic activity to decrease or reduce the load of C. jejuni and S. typhimurium in the intestines of chickens. Finally, we will construct an engineered Lactobacillus bacteria strain that displays immunogenic epitopes of C. jejuni and S. typhimurium colonization associated proteins. This vaccine strain will stimulate the production of protective antibodies, resulting in a reduction in pathogen colonization. In sum, these developed intervention strategies will be important to reduce the occurrence of both Campylobacter and Salmonella in chickens. The technology developed in this research project will be patented and licensed to biotechnology and poultry companies in Canada."
Research support,"Applied projects in the Insect Toxicology Laboratory focus on the discovery and development of botanical insecticides, including isolation and identification of active principles from plants, investigation of mechanisms of action and metabolism in insects, and effects on natural enemies. Current projects are based on plant essential oils and greenhouse pests, and toxicity of extractives from Brazilian plants. 

Basic projects in the Laboratory focus on learning and memory in insects, specifically on habituation in pest insects and the persistence of memory through metamorphosis. The role of chemosensory organs and nerves will be explored using the cabbage looper as a model insect.

Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in forests and wetlands in Western Canada,"The goal of my research is to better understand the processes controlling CO2, water vapour, N2O, and CH4 fluxes above forests and wetlands in Western Canada following disturbances. These disturbances may be further exacerbated by interannual climate variability. This research is to advance the development of technology and policy to better manage terrestrial ecosystems to increase C sequestration, minimize GHG emissions and the impacts of climate change while maximizing productivity and water use efficiency. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP), evapotranspiration (ET) and other greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes will be measured using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique. I will also use automated and manual chamber measurements to quantify the temporal and spatial variability of soil GHG fluxes, and assess the reliability of scaling up chamber measurements to stand level. One of my aims will be to measure, over the next 3-5 years, NEP and ecosystem-scale N2O fluxes in a 28-yr-old Douglas-fir stand following urea fertilization in 2017, which is consistent with recommended silvicultural practices for this stand age following crown closure. In my research on the impact of mountain pine beetle infestation on BC Interior lodgepole pine stands, I will refine the 3-PG model to predict the recovery of NEP and ET at the landscape scale, and also determine the expected rise in ecosystem respiration as a result of dead trees falling at an increased rate. The main aims of my hybrid poplar (HP) research in the Aspen parkland are to determine NEP and ET of HP plantations, their sustainability with respect to precipitation, and the effect of the silvicultural practice of planting a white spruce understory in an HP plantation on NEP and ET. The objective of my research at our southern boreal Old Aspen site is to determine the impact of a severe tent caterpillar attack in the spring of 2016 on NEP and ET over the following two years. The focus of my research at our southern boreal Old Black Spruce site will be the measurement of CH4 fluxes, which will enable us to determine whether CH4 emissions will result in the stand becoming a net GHG source considering that it is a weak carbon sink. At an urban bog site, I will make EC-measurements of water vapor, CO2 and CH4 fluxes to study the progression of these fluxes as the bog undergoes restoration by rewetting. This research will provide an excellent training environment for highly qualified personnel."
Behavioural strategies in dairy cattle coping with illness,"Improvements in genetics and nutrition result in a 2-3% increase in milk production per cow per year.
However, this increased production has put extra demands on the cow, leading to an increased incidence of infectious and metabolic disease and higher rates of involuntary culling. Despite decades of nutritional and epidemiological work, the incidence of disease in lactating dairy cattle remains excessively high, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive understanding of biological mechanisms associated with illness as well as the behavioural signs that can aid in early recognition and treatment. The long-term objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of sickness behaviour of dairy cattle suffering from infectious and metabolic diseases. This information is vital if we are to find ways of reducing morbidity in these animals. This research program will be unique in that it will be the first to describe the spectrum of sickness behaviours in dairy cattle suffering from infectious and metabolic diseases and how stress, both social and physical, affect the expression of these behaviours. This research program will also be the first to ascertain if pregnancy and parturition increase the susceptibility of dairy cows to illness, thereby causing an increase in the expression of sickness behaviours and the incidence of clinical illness.
